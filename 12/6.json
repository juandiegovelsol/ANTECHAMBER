    "review_comment": "This was my third Stanley water bottle purchase. Great design! The flip up lid makes one-handed operation easy - bought one for my nephew who lost his right arm - he loves it! The lid closes in a manner that covers the drinking area, keeping it clean (like when you drop the bottle ion the trail...) Keeps water ice-cold for hours. Easy to carry with the handle - also fits in any cup holder.\nLids are NOT sold separately, so when it will no longer flips open, it seems you have to buy another bottle...",
