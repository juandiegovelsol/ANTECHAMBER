4. Let's start with a sony 85' tv for my room

- `four_stars_and_up` is not the correct parameter to use. The model should only use `query`, `country`, and `sort_by`
- The user would like to get TV options. To fulfill the user's request, I will use the `product_search` tool with the parameters `query` set to "Sony 85 inch TV", `country` set to "US", and `sort_by` set to "RELEVANCE"

- The model incorrectly summarized the information for the TV options. The model should only include details retrieved in the `product_search` tool response.
- The user would like to get the TV options to buy. To fulfill the user's request, I will correctly summarize the product information obtained from the `product_search` tool, called with the parameters `query` set to "Sony 85 inch TV", `country` set to "US", `sort_by` set to "RELEVANCE"



5. That's sad. I can't afford any of them. Moving is so hard


6. Thank you. Is there any 65' sony TV under 700?

- The model incorrectly assumed the user wanted the lowest price TVs under $700, but the user would like the better-rated TVs under that price. The model should not use the `sort_by` parameter
