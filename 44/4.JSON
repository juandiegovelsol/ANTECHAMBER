    "review_comment": "I recently set up the SimpliSafe 8 Piece Wireless Home Security System, and I’m thoroughly impressed with how well it delivers on ease of use, functionality, and design. As someone who is very tech-savvy, I found the setup process to be a breeze. However, what truly stands out is how straightforward it is—even for those who may not be as comfortable with technology.\n\nPros:\n1. Easy Setup:\nFrom unboxing to full operation, the setup process took me less than an hour. The step-by-step instructions are clear, and the system practically guides you through the installation process. This would be perfect for anyone, regardless of their tech skills.\n\n2. Seamless Operation:\nThe wireless sensors are reliable and responsive, and the base station ensures you’re always updated with audio alerts and notifications. It’s clear SimpliSafe designed this system with user experience in mind.\n\n3. Customizability:\nYou can easily add more sensors or components as needed to tailor the system to your home.\n\n4. Design:\nThe modern, minimalist design of the components allows them to blend seamlessly into your home décor.\n\n5. Optional Monitoring:\nAlthough I don’t use the 24/7 professional monitoring, it’s a great option for those who want extra peace of mind. Even without it, the system functions flawlessly as a standalone setup.\n\nCons:\n1. Limited Integration:\nWhile the system is excellent on its own, the integration with other smart home platforms (like Alexa or Google Assistant) feels a bit limited compared to other systems.\n\n2. Price of Add-Ons:\nExpanding the system can get pricey, especially if you want to add cameras or other advanced components.\n\n3. Basic App Features Without Monitoring:\nThe app works well for alerts and customization, but some features seem locked behind the subscription plan, which might frustrate those using it without professional monitoring.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nDespite a few minor drawbacks, the SimpliSafe 8 Piece Wireless Home Security System is an outstanding choice for home security. Its combination of simplicity, reliability, and flexibility makes it a top-notch product for both tech-savvy users and those new to smart home systems. Nothing is perfect, but this system comes very close. Five stars!",

    "review_comment": "We have had security systems from two different vendors (one that came with our house, and one we tried later on). Both were workable, but very expensive...ESPECIALLY if we needed to expand them. Adding door/window sensors, cameras, etc. not only came with a very high initial cost, but also resulted in additional monthly costs above and beyond what we were already paying.  One of the vendors' equipment in particular proved to perform quite poorly; it was centered around a touchscreen keypad that would often run so slowly that it could take 5 minutes for it to recognize that a door or window had opened. The vendor, of course, had no solution except to \"upgrade\" (at our cost).\n\nWe've been researching alternatives for months. In the meantime, we've implemented things such as IP surveillance cameras and doorbell cameras, at a fraction of the cost of those offered by the above vendors. In the end, SimpliSafe just made the most sense. Purchase the equipment we want, install it ourselves (installation was SUPER easy), and pay a reasonable monitoring fee every month.\n\nAll devices are wireless, so there was no wiring to be done. The batteries will eventually drain and need to be replaced, but that is a minor nit to pick compared to the ease of not having to run sensor and keypad wiring (or try to re-use what's existing). And the system can use both our home wifi and its own cellular connectivity to dial home, so we're still protected in case our Internet fails or is cut off.\n\nThe only significant downside is that it does not directly integrate with our other smart home devices and systems. For us that's not much of an issue, because we're able to keep track of the 3-4 apps between them all, but if we absolutely had to, we could replace our existing devices with SimpliSafe ones and not have to spend too much money doing so.\n\nOverall, a great choice if you don't mind (or you enjoy) doing the installation work yourself, and have at least a basic set of technical understanding. They do have installation options, but if you're builing a system like this, you likely don't need them to install it for you.",

    "review_comment": "I have been using ADT, Honeywell and Simon systems for over 30-years, but I wanted to replace my current system with one that was Wi-Fi/Internet connected for easier remote monitoring and access. The system I was using was all wireless, but it utilized older wireless technology so I wanted to upgrade to modern wireless technology. Pricing out a newer Honeywell type system was going to cost upwards of a $1,000.00 so I shopped around and wanted to try SimpliSafe. I have installed the SimpliSafe system and here is what I have found.\n\nSimpliSafe is very easy to setup and I wrote the sensors names on a small piece of tape affixed to each sensor so I could configure them all at the same time, at the base, and then go around and install the sensors afterwards. I used the provided sticky tape for the initial sensor mounting and then followed-up up by drilling and screwing in each sensor-mounting base.\n\nMy old alarm system would allow up to 8-user codes so I could have a code for everyone to include visitors. SimpliSafe allows a maximum of 4-users codes. SimpliSafe states you have 5-codes, but one of those codes is the Master code and you should only use that code to cancel alarms or make system changes. My wife and I share a user code and the three kids have their own codes.\n\nMy old alarm system has Entry Chime and it announces the name of the door sensor as it opens so you know if someone just opened a door, like the garage door. SimpliSafe has a setting for Entry Sensor Chime, but it does not announce which sensor was activated.\n\nIf you have ten door/window sensors installed, you need to open SimpliSafe app and view the Device Settings to see if the sensor is still open as the SimpliSafe alarm does not log activity when the system is set to “Off.” When my old alarm was triggered, the alarm panel would announce which sensor caused the alarm.\n\nWhen the SimpliSafe system is armed, if someone opens and closes a door, you need to open the app to know which sensor caused the alarm. It would be nice if the SimpliSafe app had a setting for collecting all sensor activity with settings to exclude sensors from the log, like the motion sensors, even when the system is set to Off.\n\nOther alarm systems have exterior door/gate sensors, but SimpliSafe does not have any exterior door sensors at this time. I was able to find a small plastic project box that fit the SimpliSafe door sensors. Just remove the sensor slide-on mount and the door sensor fits perfectly. I have some room at one end of the box for placing some desiccant packs if I find any moisture build up in the project boxes. Now, I can monitor my gates. Here is the information on the size of the project boxes: Project Boxes ABS Plastic Electrical Project Case Power Junction Box Black 2.40 x 1.41 x 0.98 inch (61 x 36 x 25 mm).",
