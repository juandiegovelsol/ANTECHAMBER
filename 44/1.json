The fingerprint accuracy and lock functionality receive mixed feedback - while some say the fingerprint feature works well and the locking mechanism works well, others report issues with fingerprints not being recognized and being unable to unlock or lock the door. Moreover, the battery life is mixed, with some saying it lasts months before needing charged while others report issues with charging. Additionally, the Bluetooth connectivity receives negative feedback, with customers noting that it only connects through Bluetooth and the app won't connect.",

Customization is pretty mid, only connects through Bluetooth so you can not remote unlock, because you are not physically present",

      "review_title": "Specially beneficial to siblings of a Special Needs child",
      "review_comment": "**2 month update** Overall these have continued to work as desired. Main complaint: In order to use the App to unlock the doors you have to be in close proximity to the lock, which makes the feature basically worthless. Child was locked out of room due to below comment, and I was unable to remotely unlock the door while running errands. There are keys, but they are hidden so my brilliant special needs child doesn't get access the their rooms (the reason for the locks in the first place). An additional frustration, though NOT the products fault, is if you only upload one of your fingers and then damage the fingerprint (burn, skin peeling, etc.) you can no longer access...I'd encourage you to upload at least 2-3 different fingerprints just in case (which reduces the amount of people who can be programmed to the individual door knob). As others have mentioned, sometimes switching the lock from auto-locked to passageway doesn't immediately register and requires a couple turns back and forth. Hopeful that's just a tiny glitch that doesn't become permanent. Last note. Each door knob has its own configured fingerprints so the fingerprint on one doorknob is not saved in the system so that you can just add a fingerprint to a different doorknob using the app...you have to manually add a fingerprint to each doorknob. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of before buying. Altogether, still very pleased with the purchase. - - - - - - - - - - Purchased 3 Handles Having a special needs child you wreaks havoc on siblings belongings, I don’t know why I waited so long! The peace and validation it has brought for my other children was well worth the money, but hoping they last several years. Had some difficulty setting them up until I realized the problem was my WiFi and not the door handles. Overall I haven’t had any issues with them. The app is pretty easy to work, but wish I could add users without them needing an email address. Not a difficult fix, but think this would be a little more “family friendly.” Takes a few tries to do figure out where on the fingerprint will regularly spring the lock, but after that it’s good. So far, very pleased with them!! One of the handles lock switch isn’t quite as tight as I’d prefer, but hasn’t caused any issues. Only complaint is that it seems I need to be physically at the residence to unlock doors which is a little unnerving if I’m not home and one of my kids needs in",

The fingerprint scanner responds very well and it does its job perfectly, giving both security and convenience. A good buy if you’re looking for something modern and practical.",

Now I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for 3 reasons 1 there is no instruction on installation is not that hard but still also the software does not have an option to get notified for unauthorized attempts lastly does not work with alexa ! If ur okay with these it's a great well made product",
