  "customers_say": "Customers find the security system easy to install and use, with a simple app interface and good value for money, particularly appreciating the low-cost monthly monitoring plan. The system receives positive feedback for its home security features, making customers feel safer, and customers like its DIY nature. The functionality and WiFi connectivity receive mixed reviews - while some say it works well, others report it doesn't work properly and experiences connection issues. The customization aspect also gets mixed feedback, with customers appreciating the ability to add more sensors and components, though one customer notes that features are locked behind the subscription plan.",

      "review_comment": "I recently set up the SimpliSafe 8 Piece Wireless Home Security System, and Iâm thoroughly impressed with how well it delivers on ease of use, functionality, and design. As someone who is very tech-savvy, I found the setup process to be a breeze. However, what truly stands out is how straightforward it isâeven for those who may not be as comfortable with technology. Pros: 1. Easy Setup: From unboxing to full operation, the setup process took me less than an hour. The step-by-step instructions are clear, and the system practically guides you through the installation process. This would be perfect for anyone, regardless of their tech skills. 2. Seamless Operation: The wireless sensors are reliable and responsive, and the base station ensures youâre always updated with audio alerts and notifications. Itâs clear SimpliSafe designed this system with user experience in mind. 3. Customizability: You can easily add more sensors or components as needed to tailor the system to your home. 4. Design: The modern, minimalist design of the components allows them to blend seamlessly into your home dÃ©cor. 5. Optional Monitoring: Although I donât use the 24/7 professional monitoring, itâs a great option for those who want extra peace of mind. Even without it, the system functions flawlessly as a standalone setup. Cons: 1. Limited Integration: While the system is excellent on its own, the integration with other smart home platforms (like Alexa or Google Assistant) feels a bit limited compared to other systems. 2. Price of Add-Ons: Expanding the system can get pricey, especially if you want to add cameras or other advanced components. 3. Basic App Features Without Monitoring: The app works well for alerts and customization, but some features seem locked behind the subscription plan, which might frustrate those using it without professional monitoring. Final Thoughts: Despite a few minor drawbacks, the SimpliSafe 8 Piece Wireless Home Security System is an outstanding choice for home security. Its combination of simplicity, reliability, and flexibility makes it a top-notch product for both tech-savvy users and those new to smart home systems. Nothing is perfect, but this system comes very close. Five stars!",

      "review_title": "A good alternative to overpriced, for-rent systems",
      "review_comment": "We have had security systems from two different vendors (one that came with our house, and one we tried later on). Both were workable, but very expensive...ESPECIALLY if we needed to expand them. Adding door/window sensors, cameras, etc. not only came with a very high initial cost, but also resulted in additional monthly costs above and beyond what we were already paying. One of the vendors' equipment in particular proved to perform quite poorly; it was centered around a touchscreen keypad that would often run so slowly that it could take 5 minutes for it to recognize that a door or window had opened. The vendor, of course, had no solution except to \"upgrade\" (at our cost). We've been researching alternatives for months. In the meantime, we've implemented things such as IP surveillance cameras and doorbell cameras, at a fraction of the cost of those offered by the above vendors. In the end, SimpliSafe just made the most sense. Purchase the equipment we want, install it ourselves (installation was SUPER easy), and pay a reasonable monitoring fee every month. All devices are wireless, so there was no wiring to be done. The batteries will eventually drain and need to be replaced, but that is a minor nit to pick compared to the ease of not having to run sensor and keypad wiring (or try to re-use what's existing). And the system can use both our home wifi and its own cellular connectivity to dial home, so we're still protected in case our Internet fails or is cut off. The only significant downside is that it does not directly integrate with our other smart home devices and systems. For us that's not much of an issue, because we're able to keep track of the 3-4 apps between them all, but if we absolutely had to, we could replace our existing devices with SimpliSafe ones and not have to spend too much money doing so. Overall, a great choice if you don't mind (or you enjoy) doing the installation work yourself, and have at least a basic set of technical understanding. They do have installation options, but if you're builing a system like this, you likely don't need them to install it for you.",

      "review_comment": "This is probably the only system that you do not need subscription to work. We live in Canada and they do not support - alerts are sent to only me which is not an issue. And we do not have cameras which would require a subscription for full usefulness. Setting up door and water sensors and motion detectors is straight forward although I had an issue in that I set up at our house, to test out, and then moved to our seasonal cabin. For the life of me, could NOT change WiFi network and searching internet did not help. NOTE: you can change in SETTINGS on the keypad but you MUST enter the MASTER password. I was using the codes I programmed for entry, which do not let you into settings. I had forgotten that I had a MASTER password. After that, setup was so EASY. Each device pairs with a simple push of the SYNC button. The motion sensors stick up with tape, but I added small screw for stability. Similarly with out patio doors and the sensors. Everything has been working for weeks. Compared to old style alarm system requiring engineering degree to set up, this was a breeze.",

El monitoreo, bueno, sin monitoreo no tienes acceso ni a la App ni al website y por ende tampoco recibes notificaciones en caso de activarse, pero funciona a modo local y se presume que es suficiente para espantar a los rateros o por lo menos alertar a los vecinos quienes te llamarÃ¡n para que calles la chicharra, ja ja.",
