    "review_comment": "First time I bought a perfume after a TikTok review and review was spot on. Lovely scent you do get the cream and strawberry and marshmallow. Very long lasting all day and longer. Very light and feminine. Lovely bottle and packaging but most of all a gorgeous scent that lingers and is not nauseating. If you’ve never tried perfumes from this company definitely try this one, the price is great and you won’t be disappointed.",

    "review_comment": "This perfume was a blind buy for me, and I’m so glad I took the chance! It has such a lovely, soft fruity smell that feels feminine and sweet without being overpowering. I’ve received so many compliments whenever I wear it. The only downside is that it doesn’t last very long—about three hours at most on my skin—but for the price and how beautiful it smells, I think it’s absolutely worth it. If you enjoy fruity perfumes, this one is definitely worth trying.",

    "review_comment": "This is a 97% inspiration for ybm by another company. This perfume last about 7 hrs on my clothes and about 5 hrs on my skin. I brought the OG and it lasted 20 min on clothing and 5 minutes on skin and for that high price I think Not! This one is such a great deal for how much you get for $35 as of 8/2025. Only con is to me the bottle is tacky and hideous but the scent is a dream. It’s fluffy and 2% sweeter than the OG no other difference!.\n\nNOW…I’m not for any hyped up perfumes because it’s always a social media ploy (que side eye) so no, this won’t your eyes roll back, and no this won’t make ppl chase you down in a grocery store to smell you etc but it does project moderately and those close enough to you will compliment you if u spray about 5 sprays. Also it’s soft enough if your like me and like wearing soft scents around the house and to bed in this case I spray 1-2 times. Smells more “inspired than the other marshmallow ones that I’ve brought that are pink also",
