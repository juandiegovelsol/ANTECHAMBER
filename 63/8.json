  "customers_say": "Customers find these organic cotton sheets soft and comfortable, noting they become softer with each wash and are easy to sleep on. The sheets receive positive feedback for their quality, fit, and value for money, with one customer specifically mentioning how well they hug the mattress. The color receives mixed reviews - while some appreciate the bright white appearance, others note the color doesn't match expectations. Additionally, several customers mention the sheets are rather thin.",

      "review_comment": "UPDATE 6/1/24: I decided to update the review after a couple months of use- because I feel that’s fair. I did end up purchasing a second set in the bright white. These sheets wash really well, dry quickly on the low dryer setting, and they DO get softer after each wash! There’s no pilling, and I’ve not had to worry about whether they will rip or tear. It seems that they will last quite a long time. I am completely happy with my purchase! I’ll purchase them for as long as they continue to make and carry them! After eyeballing these sheets and the reviews for a while, they went on sale-further reduced from an already low price (we all know how expensive sheets can be). My thought process was of these sheets didn’t work out, I didn’t spend that much and it wouldn’t be a huge loss. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! It took a bit to receive them, but they showed up yesterday and I immediately put them in the wash, and dried on low as instructed. They didn’t take too long to dry- and naturally, 100% cotton is going to be a little more wrinkly than others. That doesn’t bother me. I put these sheets on straight out of the dryer. I had zero issues with the fitted sheet fitting my mattress. The top sheet is not as wide as I’m used to, but it’s large enough. Now, the real test! We slept on them last night. They are so soft! Now, if you’re used to the sateen feel- this is going to be a little different. I’ve had all sheet ranges in the past from 1000 thread count, to 200 thread count. I sleep warm, so I need sheets that breathe and can’t use the 1000 thread counts. These sheets fit the bill perfectly! I felt like they are breathable, and I didn’t sweat. I was so cozy. In fact, I woke up a few times in the middle of the night just to move around in bed and relish in the coziness. They honestly feel like the sheets we’ve slept in at the Four Seasons hotel. Are they super thick? No. But I dislike thick sheets. They seem very well made and I have no concerns that they are going to last. Others have mentioned that they further soften with each wash. I’m looking forward to that and truly considering purchasing more and throwing away all of my old sets. I purchased the bright white, so I’ve had no issues with color as others have. They are truly bright white. I regret not purchasing these sooner!",

      "review_comment": "I've reached that point in time when, no matter how you try to convince yourself your sheets have a few more washes before they disintegrate, you realize you've already lost that battle. So that means I needed to buy sheets. This set came up in my search and noticed they were more than reasonable in cost for Organic Cotton. My concerns were then turned to how do they survive; like by using cheap labor? Or other unethical practices? I was relieved when I read through the product info and photos that Lane Linen noted that this is ethically made with Fair Trade Practices. This brand even provides a reusable bag that holds the sheets instead of plastic wrapping. With the facts in hand, I took the chance and purchased the Queen set in white. I confess that I expected cheap sheets that would last a few washes then become so thin they wouldn't be worth keeping (ending up on my closet shelf), but was willing to take the chance for the price. I received the sheets on Christmas Eve, as I needed my sheets for the Guest Room in my house. Since I threw the bad sheets away, I only had my set of sheets. I figured I would use my washed sheets and put the Lane Linen sheets on my bed just in case they weren't great. I ended up really pleasantly surprised along with being extremely impressed. The quality is there. I know most people will complain that they aren't heavy enough. Well, to me, living in Florida, well these are downright perfect for this weather zone. And yes, they may not be a 1000 count sheets, but after weekly washing, the sheets have gotten softer and softer, and have yet to get thinner. The lint tray in the dryer doesn't fill up with tons of cotton which means to me this product's sheets are well made by the means of a great weaving of those sheets. I did see some people have written reviews saying they have a 15\" mattress and the fitted bottom sheet doesn't fit. I guess I'm the lucky one. My 15\" memory foam Queen mattress (with no pillow top) has no issue as the sheet fits perfectly. Out of the dryer, it is tight, however, after one night, I noticed that the fitted sheet relaxed and went back to its normal size. My Review: PROs: Inexpensive, Organic cotton, no chemicals touch the sheets hence never put you at danger, ethically sourced by an environmentally committed company, Queen sized pillowcases included (not standard size). CONs: A few dollars more for pigment dyed sheets, the sheets do wrinkle so they may not be for everyone, the sheets aren't extremely soft when you first get them. But they aren't scratchy. They are like brand new sheets that weren't soaked in chemicals to soften them. I have found that as I wash them weekly, they have gotten softer and softer. Overall: I personally love the sheet set and highly recommend. I did iron the very top part of the sheet along with the pillowcases the first time I washed them. Since I have noticed that the sheets get less wrinkles after each washing, they go from the dryer to the bed. I think I'll be buying more in the very near future especially since I love sleeping in these sheets. Try them yourself. I think you'll be pleased with the quality.",

So I am changing my rating to 5 stars for excellent service. The sheets arrived very fragrant. Not just the horrid fragrances that amazon sprays on everything, but with a fragrance of their own embedded. Since they are supposed to be organic, the addition of toxic fragrance is not impressive. However, it is not one of those forever fragrances and I was able to remove it with several washings and using the clothes line. Once free of that problem, the sheets are nice. Not as silky as percale generally is, but not rough. They are very warm and will make nice winter weight sheets until they start to wear out. The pillow cases are very nice, with the additional flap that covers the entire pillow. I wish they had 4 pillowcases or had the matching pillow cases for sale.",

      "review_comment": "Won't lie, I assumed these sheets would be cheap and not last, but the price was right and if they were actually the thread-count promised in the description, should be soft and comfy for however long I could keep them in good shape. Imagine my surprise when they turned out to be not only the correct thread-count but softer than expected and, despite them being thinner that I thought they'd be, warm and cozy when you swaddle yourself, but cooling when you stretch out beneath them! That might sound weird, but true, high-count cotton sheets should provide that kind of temp control naturally. We've gotten so used to poly-cotton blends, or that rip-off of high-count cotton that's basically flannelized polyester, that hold SO much heat - lovely in winter but, even then, can be a bit TOO hot. I like to sleep cool but need to be warm to FALL asleep, so true high-count cotton sheets have been a godsend. Unfortunately, they're hard to find and can be expensive. If you're in the same bind as me, I highly recommend these sheets. They've gone through 3 washings so far and are still in great shape, don't wrinkle very easily (as long as you take them out of the dryer before they've cooled - they can only do so much on their own!), and are soft as all get out....mmmm cozy. :) I can wrap them around me and they insulate my cold hands and feet enough that I warm up fast to fall asleep, but when I inevitably spread out during my slumber, they keep me cool enough that I don't wake up in the middle of the night sweating from overheating. If they last another 7 washings, they'll have lasted as long as the last set I purchased for twice the price. If they last 2 more washings (and I see no reason why they wouldn't, they look like I just took them out of the package), I'll have gotten my money's worth. Either way, I'm very satisfied and am picking up another set ASAP.",
