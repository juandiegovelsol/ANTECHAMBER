    "review_comment": "This ECG monitor is very nice & easy to use.  It is larger than the other brand I had and misplaced who knows where!  It is very easy to connect to bluetooth and the viewing screen is a nice size. I like that there is ability for 2 users to track results.  The results go to my phone and lists time, date, heart rate, and results.  Very happy with this purchase.",

    "review_comment": "I bought this device to monitor my wifeâ€™s heart condition, in which she has arrhythmia. It has successfully picked up that condition and we are able to track any changes between doctor visits. The peace of mind this provides us is worth the purchase price alone. Of course I use it for myself as well. You never know when a heart condition may develop. This is my second EMAY device, my first one being a one lead ecg monitor. I appreciate the additional information provided by the six leads. It is easy to use right out of the box, but I did notice that you need to make good contact on all the leads to get reliable data. I really appreciate that there are no subscription fees associated with device. Why get penalized for my monitoring your own health?! Very happy with this purchase.",

    "review_comment": "I got this monitor due to a recent onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. I have been evaluated and will be getting an ablation in a few weeks, so this monitor is being used to verify episodes of Afib so I can keep my cardiologist in the loop. As a backround, I am a paramedic, so I do not necessarily need the machine interpretation but it is nice to have and it appears to be accurate in it's characterization of if a rhythm strip is normal or Afib. The printouts it provides are clear and easy to read in ios, android, and on my Mac, no issues at all with connection to various devices and setup took only a few minutes for each device. All in all, the Emay monitor does absolutely everything I need it to do, and does it quite well.\n\nThe overwhelming reason I selected the Emay device was that it DOES NOT require a subscription to use unlike the other devices. A monthly fee is an absolute deal breaker.",

    "review_comment": "As a former firefighter paramedic, I have experience, knowledge and understanding of EKG machines and heart rhythms. As an athlete, I monitor my health by tracking my vital signs. I use a pulse oximeter and blood pressure machine, but I have not had a portable EKG machine until now.\nThis device is a standalone, portable EKG machine that has the option of a 1 or 6 lead reading. As I understand it, more leads means more views of the heart so if a problem exists, it can be identified. The device is small, lightweight and very durable. The screen is easy to read and the instructions are clear. I have found it very important to wet your fingers, thumbs and the top of the left thigh for proper conductivity in the 6 lead function. Also, I have found it useful to lightly touch the sensors with your thumbs. As it states in the instructions, if you squeeze, it can cause artifact and an improper reading.. I don't touch my leg with my fingers and l don't move. It's very convenient and easy to use. I also like that it's a standalone device and that it has the option of pairing with an app. Attached is a photo of a recent reading of mine after using the device. Thank you.",
