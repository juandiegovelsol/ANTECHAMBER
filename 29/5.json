The data is saved and downloaded making it very easy to track trends. I also was able to leave a remark about factors that could be contributing to sp02 specifics. Very easy to use. The instructions are very specific. The smartphone app is also easy to use and includes an online manual that you can view anytime. The reports are easy to understand and allows you to be in charge of your own health. Great price too! Highly recommend/",

      "review_comment": "I have been using this Pulse Oximeter Recorder for a week to monitor my sleep apnea. It is easy to use and generates very detailed reports after every night which you can download as a PDF or an image file. You can also download the raw data to import into Excel if you like to do your own analysis. The 48 hour data limit is not a problem if you download the data every day, since it clears the device memory once you download the data. I charge mine every morning when I get up after I download the data, so the device is ready to go the next night. Battery life is not an issue since I charge it daily. The finger cuff is comfortable to wear, although the little velcro strap to hold the device/wire against your finger is marginal. I use a small strip of self adhesive medical tape to secure it better. Before I started using the tape, I did have the device come off my finger while I was sleeping a few times, but the device started recording again once I woke up and put the cuff back on my finger. The data collection just shows a blank during that time. The device syncs its time to your phone via the app. The app (Android for me) is easy to navigate and works well to access reports and status. This is the only recording pulse oximeter I have used, so I cannot compare to other brands or devices. But this one meets my needs beautifully.",

      "review_comment": "I don't write many reviews, but I purchased Emay's fingertip monitor a few weeks ago and really liked it. It was well-built for the price, and the app was easy to use and provided allot of good information. I realized, however, that I needed something I could wear for long periods. I use a cpap, have afib, and wanted to monitor my oxygen throughout the night. I have a Fitbit watch, but it just gives me an average and not the data. Which led me to this. This wrist SpO2 monitor was designed to be worn for extended periods... I'm guessing it would also work great if you wanted to monitor your pulse and SpO2 during exercise. I was quite honestly surprised at how comfortable it was, how well it was made, and how easy it was to use. The fingertip sensor is in a rubber sleeve that goes over your finger, and it holds it snug but doesn't squeeze like other models. When I look at a breakdown in the data for the night, there are no gaps where the sensor has slipped off or moved. The wrist portion houses the battery and all of the electronics, to keep the sensor light on your finger. Note that there is no instant display of the data, until you transfer it to your phone, which is I'm guessing the reason for the long battery life. I was a able to get 3 solid nights on a charge, roughly 24 hours. I have purchased a handful of SpO2 monitors, and this is by far now my favorite. It is also the most accurate, and based on the report from this monitor my doctor is now considering supplemental oxygen. If you want to spot check your pulse rate or SpO2 you should still get a fingertip monitor for an instant reading, but your result will never be as good as wearing it all night. I have looked through all the pr SpO2 monitors on Amazon, and haven't found one better than this for the price. I highly recommend it.",

In addition to the thorough detail that the EMAY Summary report has, I discovered that it also imports minute-to-minute oxygen level data from your overnight reading into the Apple MyHealth app which is useful to view on your overall health summary dashboard and one that I missed seeing when I upgraded my Apple Watch where the Blood Oxygen feature wasn’t included in the newer Apple watch series. I took the EMAY Summary Reports to two different healthcare providers who were both equally impressed with the level of detail and accuracy that the reports show. Both commented that they were going to recommend this product to their patients and how useful it will be in their treatment plan. In addition to a solid product, the customer service is outstanding. I received an email from the service team checking to make sure my device was working well for me and asking if I had any follow up questions or suggestions.

The app is super easy to install and provides data which is simple to understand. Being able to assess sleep health has proved very beneficial. I bought it to assess my breathing as hadn’t worn my CPAP mask for 2 weeks and wondered what effect this had on my oxygen levels. Well I soon found out that things weren’t great - large oxygen dips and varying pulse levels. Each night I’d try something different (pillows/breathe easy strips/no alcohol) in the hope that if I could reduce my sleep apnea incidents I’d not need my CPAP mask anymore. Wishful thinking! BUT this amazing 02 wrist monitor has allowed me to to understand just how much I need my mask and not dislike it so much! Worth every penny, best purchase I’ve made in a long time.",
