    "review_comment": "I purchased the Blue Yeti microphone on Amazon, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The sound quality is crystal clear and professional — perfect for recording vocals, streaming, or podcasting. I was impressed by how easy it was to set up; it’s literally plug-and-play with no complicated installation needed. The build feels sturdy and high-quality, and the different pickup patterns make it super versatile for solo use or group recordings. Compared to other mics I’ve tried, this one delivers studio-level performance at a great price. If you’re serious about clear, reliable audio, I highly recommend the Blue Yeti.",

    "review_comment": "First of all, all me to state that those who wrote poor reviews for this mic must be quite privileged musicians with a load of experience or audio engineers who have an allegiance to a certain brand, because they are all sorely mistaken. The Yeti is, in my opinion as a singer/songwriter searching for decent recording equipment for the last year, a fantastic, well priced microphone for people looking to record quality sound. It seems quite versatile and craftily engineered.\n\nI have spent the last year in a hotel in the middle of London recording my guitar and vocals on garageband through the mic on my computer. It sounded like complete crap...and not because I am an awful musician, but because the microphone my MacBook Pro wasn't up to the standards I need for recording, maybe I was too close or maybe too far away, the point is that it is not possible to judge a proper distance from the mic as it is minuscule, and difficult to locate. In addition, the plosives and many harder guitar strums were enrobed in static and just sounded awful. I tweaked the equalizer as much as I could to make them sound manageable, but, alas, I no longer need to do that. Thanks to my Yeti.\n\nOf course a usb mic won't sound as thrilling as a standard microphone suited up with proper impedance cables and monitor buddies, but when you buy a mic that connects via usb, one's standards cannot be held too high. This mic, with such appropriate standards in mind, met and surpassed what I had anticipated. The vocals are clear, the guitar is clear, and because of that effects through garage band work more effectively. No longer am I struggling with shrill sounds and bassy guitar twangs, no longer am I wasting all my time clarifying the songs, I am simply recording, editing, and feeling so much better about my music.\n\nIt is true, I have never played in a studio, or used thousand dollar mics, but it is also true that I do not have the money neither for time in a recording studio in London, nor for the more expensive Blue microphones, thereby, I went this route and I couldn't be any happier. If you are struggling with clarity and play more mellow/soft rock/pop rock/acoustic/ambient/coffee shop etc music, then this is a real advantage for you in the small studio you are beginning to assemble in your room or basement or apartment. If you are a heavy rocker, maybe it isn't a good choice, but I haven't attempted screaming into this mic yet...probably wouldn't be smart in a hotel in central London.\n\nAs for travel, it isn't a exactly the best portable size, but in this case I don't think a quality mic will be. Maybe you can try the Snowflake, but I'll bet my insignificant income that it will not be as munificent. Also, G-Band is the only program I have used with it. It is very compatible, though I will say I was confused at first as to why there was no sound coming out of my computer, but I quickly realized that there is a headphone jack built into the mic for a good reason. It may seem like a possible flaw, but I think it makes things much easier. And do yourself a favor, toss the earbuds and buy some real recording headphones, you know? The ones that cost more than six bucks at TJ Maxx. I am not saying to buy Beats, I am just saying that everything sounds like a band of gorillas pounding on tin cans through the buds--and maybe you're saying \"no, I have some stellar buds!\" Well good for you, I haven't found any so don't rub it in.\n\nI gave this five stars because I don't know any better, but four stars seems stupid and awkward, its like the age of twenty, not quite twenty one but have been drunk since eighteen, it is a four in the terms of mics that I have experienced, but under the given conditions it is definitely a five. I say buy it if you meet my described criterium, but who am I but a simple singer/songwriter.\n\nEnjoy!",

It has a number of ways to control the type of audio output so you can really customize your sound depending on if you are podcasting alone or with others, gaming, etc.\n\nIt connects via wire but I prefer that and it’s high quality!",

I have not found a way to use it as an external mic to my galaxy S23 ultra. but I probably haven't found all the proper hardware yet. its definitely not plug and play from that perspective, since the phone cant power the microphone (there are no separate power input and audio jacks). I am happy with my purchase.",

    "review_comment": "This is a great mic if you are looking to start using mic for voiceovers or podcast and even gaming. I would say this is the best you can get under $100 . And a great piece to start with if you are a beginner. I really like the mic. Straight out of the box it starts its job. Also, it’s a plug and play which means USB to your system and start talking.The sound is studio level clear and great.  It also needs a headphone. However, if you are doing advanced professional work and have noisy setting, then this is not your mic unless you are going to do a lot of audio editing . I’m a content creator who does a lot of tutorials. I don’t do too much editing or want to spend so much time fine tuning because I also have kids. No matter where I stay , my home is always going to be noisy.. and this mic picks up every sound …even the slightest noise it will pick it up. When I’m recording, my kids stay quiet but even the slightest sound like walking around it picks up. And being that I don’t want to spend too much time editing audio, this may not be a great option for my own situation. Hence, I will be returning it. Regardless, it is still a great Mic and it comes with its own built in stand so you don’t have to purchase a stand for it…",
