      "review_comment": "My use case for this is 99% home office oriented. I was tired of dealing with headsets and every USB speakerphone I tried resulted in crappy voice quality, so I took the plunge on this a week ago. It matches my other Logitech gear (keyboard, mouse, webcam), and people have commented very positively on the audio quality on their end of calls. I am really amazed at how it filters out background noise‚Ä¶I did a test call with music blaring three feet away and it still captured only my voice So now, I have my perfect home office - just the microphone plus external speakers. No more headsets, speakerphones, or earbuds. Awesome! Only downside is that G Hub isn‚Äôt working with it on my MacBook - says there‚Äôs a driver problem and Logitech hasn‚Äôt been able to help yet. It still functions fine but I can‚Äôt use the Blue Voice features. If I plug it into my Windows box, G Hub is fine.",
