      "review_comment": "First of all, all me to state that those who wrote poor reviews for this mic must be quite privileged musicians with a load of experience or audio engineers who have an allegiance to a certain brand, because they are all sorely mistaken. The Yeti is, in my opinion as a singer/songwriter searching for decent recording equipment for the last year, a fantastic, well priced microphone for people looking to record quality sound. It seems quite versatile and craftily engineered. I have spent the last year in a hotel in the middle of London recording my guitar and vocals on garageband through the mic on my computer. It sounded like complete crap...and not because I am an awful musician, but because the microphone my MacBook Pro wasn't up to the standards I need for recording, maybe I was too close or maybe too far away, the point is that it is not possible to judge a proper distance from the mic as it is minuscule, and difficult to locate. In addition, the plosives and many harder guitar strums were enrobed in static and just sounded awful. I tweaked the equalizer as much as I could to make them sound manageable, but, alas, I no longer need to do that. Thanks to my Yeti. Of course a usb mic won't sound as thrilling as a standard microphone suited up with proper impedance cables and monitor buddies, but when you buy a mic that connects via usb, one's standards cannot be held too high. This mic, with such appropriate standards in mind, met and surpassed what I had anticipated. The vocals are clear, the guitar is clear, and because of that effects through garage band work more effectively. No longer am I struggling with shrill sounds and bassy guitar twangs, no longer am I wasting all my time clarifying the songs, I am simply recording, editing, and feeling so much better about my music. It is true, I have never played in a studio, or used thousand dollar mics, but it is also true that I do not have the money neither for time in a recording studio in London, nor for the more expensive Blue microphones, thereby, I went this route and I couldn't be any happier. If you are struggling with clarity and play more mellow/soft rock/pop rock/acoustic/ambient/coffee shop etc music, then this is a real advantage for you in the small studio you are beginning to assemble in your room or basement or apartment. If you are a heavy rocker, maybe it isn't a good choice, but I haven't attempted screaming into this mic yet...probably wouldn't be smart in a hotel in central London. As for travel, it isn't a exactly the best portable size, but in this case I don't think a quality mic will be. Maybe you can try the Snowflake, but I'll bet my insignificant income that it will not be as munificent. Also, G-Band is the only program I have used with it. It is very compatible, though I will say I was confused at first as to why there was no sound coming out of my computer, but I quickly realized that there is a headphone jack built into the mic for a good reason. It may seem like a possible flaw, but I think it makes things much easier. And do yourself a favor, toss the earbuds and buy some real recording headphones, you know? The ones that cost more than six bucks at TJ Maxx. I am not saying to buy Beats, I am just saying that everything sounds like a band of gorillas pounding on tin cans through the buds--and maybe you're saying \"no, I have some stellar buds!\" Well good for you, I haven't found any so don't rub it in. I gave this five stars because I don't know any better, but four stars seems stupid and awkward, its like the age of twenty, not quite twenty one but have been drunk since eighteen, it is a four in the terms of mics that I have experienced, but under the given conditions it is definitely a five. I say buy it if you meet my described criterium, but who am I but a simple singer/songwriter. Enjoy!",

There are several microphone setting so that you can make the microphone an omni- directional, cardioid, bi-directional and stereo capabilities. It is an excellent streaming mic for Zoom, Skype, etc.... You can also mute the mic instantly by pushing a button on the front as well as a volume control if you are using headphones. It is very easy to use as well as setup. It can be mounted as a boom mic or as a standalone mic as it come with a stand. Its a great all around mic and Id recommend this to someone looking for a mid price range mic as it meets a lot of the needs for streamer and people who record music",

      "review_comment": "This is a great mic if you are looking to start using mic for voiceovers or podcast and even gaming. I would say this is the best you can get under $100 . And a great piece to start with if you are a beginner. I really like the mic. Straight out of the box it starts its job. Also, it’s a plug and play which means USB to your system and start talking.The sound is studio level clear and great. It also needs a headphone. However, if you are doing advanced professional work and have noisy setting, then this is not your mic unless you are going to do a lot of audio editing . I’m a content creator who does a lot of tutorials. I don’t do too much editing or want to spend so much time fine tuning because I also have kids. No matter where I stay , my home is always going to be noisy.. and this mic picks up every sound …even the slightest noise it will pick it up. When I’m recording, my kids stay quiet but even the slightest sound like walking around it picks up. And being that I don’t want to spend too much time editing audio, this may not be a great option for my own situation. Hence, I will be returning it. Regardless, it is still a great Mic and it comes with its own built in stand so you don’t have to purchase a stand for it…",

I have not found a way to use it as an external mic to my galaxy S23 ultra. but I probably haven't found all the proper hardware yet. its definitely not plug and play from that perspective, since the phone cant power the microphone (there are no separate power input and audio jacks).

I don't think the pictures do it justice. White was $40 cheaper and I think it's because the pictures make the white one look cheap but it looks great, sounds great and is super sturdy... I was actually surprised at how heavy it is. It also records in stereo, kinda. Using one of the different functions you'll see the left and right tracks are slightly different as it has three condensers inside that pick up the sound differently based on the position from which the sound emanated. Pretty sweet. Very happy so far.",

      "review_comment": "Se rompió mi anterior micrófono Samson de gama media/baja y decidí dar un salto de precio y calidad. Después de informarme medianamente del tema decidí por este modelo clásico de Blue Yeti. No sé cómo será el modelo más nuevo, pero este que fue la primera edición y tiene una relación calidad precio inmejorable; comprendo que no lo bajen de precio aún haciendo ya varios años que está en el mercado. Yo lo compré en una oferta flash a un buen precio de menos de 100 euros y a día de hoy ya no sabría grabar con otro micrófono de gama inferior. Lo que se refiere al micrófono en si, tiene un precio más que asequible con el que se pueden obtener resultados profesionales, aun contando con una conexión USB lo cual no es nada habitual en micrófonos de tan alta calidad. Su tamaño con la peana es algo grande, de unos 30 centímetros de altura, y su peso con peana incluida debe rondar alrededor de un kilo. El peso del conjunto es considerable pero denota calidad de materiales y una buena construcción con sensación robusta y Premium. No obstante, el hecho del peso no supone ningún inconveniente a la hora de su manejo, pues su tamaño y peso tampoco son desorbitados ya que está pensado para usar con su peana que es reclinable o con un brazo telescópico, eso sí, en el supuesto de necesitar un brazo deberemos utilizar uno relativamente fuerte y que sea compatible con el micrófono que se deberá conectar mediante una rosca hembra que está en la base del micrófono (mirar segunda foto). En cuanto a la grabación, el micrófono consta de una rueda frontal para la ganancia y otra para el modo de grabación de entre cuatro modos seleccionables: estéreo, bidireccional para entrevista, unidireccional para podcast y que no se oiga sonido ambiente, y omnidireccional para que pueda captar todos los sonidos ambientales en 360º, pudiendo conseguir así grabaciones en todo tipo de circunstancias según la necesidad. La calidad de grabación es excelente, y más aún tratándose de un micrófono de este precio. Con una buena ecualización los resultados no tienen nada que envidiar a cualquier otro micrófono mucho más caro de uso profesional. Utilizado para grabar diferentes palos del Flamenco con Guitarra Clásica o Española, Cajón y palmas. Cuándo muestro mis grabaciones a otras personas que no son precisamente neófitas en el mundo de la música se quedan boquiabiertos, literalmente me dicen que si no les hubiera dicho nada habrían pensado que se ha producido en un estudio de grabación profesional. En definitiva, un micrófono altamente recomendable más aún si tienes presupuesto ajustado. No te arrepentirás.",

However, I record in OBS and have set up filters for the mic to improve the audio and reduce the background noise. Mic has multiple control knobs on the mic, one increases headphone volume, one increases mic volume (gain) there is a dial that changes where the mic picks up sound from, have a look into which best suits you and which each means, but for my purposes, it works great. It does use the old style usb to micro usb, which is relatively uncommon, but connects well. Overall the mic is really good, looks sleek, but my only criticism is the stand it comes with, while sturdy, where it screws into the mic comes loose quickly without moving it, meaning the mic can turn unexpectedly. This is expected as many recommend getting a different stand or bracket.",
