It moves so much air that there's a lovely sheet of cool, fresh air rushing under the gap under the door (a little over an inch, hard floors) as the air rushes in to replace the output of this little beast.",

At the moment (temp in 90s all this week) I’m sleeping with a window a/c on low and this fan moving air around not only the room it’s in but into connected spaces. Works beautifully. Keeps things cool with just a touch of ac to lower the air temp slightly. Even on medium easy to sleep through (and I’m a light sleeper). I also bought an ARA for stronger air movement on first floor. That’s a different beast for a different purpose (move air longer distance). I may also get another of these because it works so well at what it’s supposed to do. Vornado customer service (needed for ARA, not this) is fantastic.",

      "review_comment": "Vornado Model 660 Fan: Vornado fans are not necessarily inexpensive fans, but I think they are worth the money. The model 660 is currently one of their largest floor models, and can move a lot of air. Right now, in the middle of being under a heat dome with temperatures reaching the high 90's and up to 100 degrees, I have been using mine constantly - sometimes by itself, and other times in conjunction with the AC. This Vornado 660 has four speeds; I found the lowest speed to be very quiet. As you increase the speed, the fan is understandably louder - as it would be with any fan. This fan does not oscillate, but you can change the angle from pointing down to the floor to up toward the ceiling. It is also supposed to be easy to open up to clean the blades, but I cannot comment on that yet, since I have only had the fan about two weeks.",

      "review_comment": "As a child, I loved the summer. As an older adult, I dread it, especially living in the Northeastern coastal U.S. As June approaches every year, I tell myself \"this will be a bearable summer\" and by late July, I feel like I am living out a prison sentence of punishment by extreme heat. 2022 has been especially brutal with several long heatwaves where the temperature was in the high 90s every day for weeks on end. It never went below the high 80s at night, so no relief. My rental house is nearly 100 years old with the windows being too rotted to hold an air conditioner or in some cases to even open. Since I moved back to the East coast, i have acquired nearly a dozen fans of all types-box fans, tower fans, tiny portables that clip to the edge of my desk. None have been particularly successful at keeping any room even reasonably comfortable. Earlier this year, in preparation for several months of heat torture, I bought a Vornado 630 for the bedroom. While it did not create a cool oasis for drifitng off to a comfortable sleep, it at least moved hot air around. As weeks went by and the heat waves got longer and my house retained more heat, I decided life was too short to be this uncomforatble and I bought this $100 Vornado 660. I used it last night for the first time on the highest setting along with the 630 on the other side of the room, also on the highest setting. I was able to sleep under a light coverlet. In addition, it was the first time since early June that I slept peacefully and comfortably all night long and woke up feeling refreshed and well rested. Even my youngest cat spent the entire night on the bed with me. Is it noisy? No. Sure, it sounds like a fan but I consider that white noise a plus as I live on a major artery in a very big city. It doesn't roar or rattle or rumble or hum so I do not understand the comments about this being a nuisance or detriment to sleep. Who cares if it has no remote control? Are we now all so lazy and helpless that getting up to push a button has become problematic or a major issue?! It was so wonderful to wake up in dry, not sweat soaked night clothes and to spend a pleasant 30 minutes gradually coming to full wakefulness while enjoying the company of my dear little cat, who also had a cool, restful night. As it is mid-August and the dog days are waning, I don't feel a need to immediately spend another $100 on a second Vornado 660 but I may very well purchase a second unit at the end of the summer as defense against next year's brutal weather. Global warming isn't going to go away but this fan can get one through some of the worst of the summer. Worth every cent. Highly recommend!",

On level two, I still don't mind the noise to sleep and it's super powerful! We point it toward the ceiling and it feels like we have AC on! Almost a little too cold sometimes. Our room is 12x11 ish. But I feel like this would be good for an even bigger room. I haven't used the other levels as we don't need to. They do get significantly louder the higher level you go and very powerful in output. The only problem is we have replaced this once as it started making a shaky noise within a month. But the company's customer service is amazing and they will send you a replacement right away. I think they have a 5 year warrenty? I'll never go back to a regular fan again!",
