      "review_comment": "Best space heater I’ve ever had. The fan in this unit moves air better than others that I’ve owned and it really does throw the heat twice as far. It’s got some nice thermostat controls that let you choose a temperature up to 95 degrees and it maintains that temperature nicely. The other option is H1 (low), H2 (medium) and H3 (high) which control heat output without dialing in specific temperatures. And then there’s basic fan mode with no heat. It’s well built and operates very quietly. I use it in the bathroom (might be overkill) and I always get warm towels stepping out of the shower. When turning the unit off. The heat stops immediately but the fan will continue to spin with a 30 second count down to cool down the unit. A nice feature. I love this little heater and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for one.",

Instructions were mostly clear enough to just use the quick set-up sheet. Choosing between just on with one of the settings or auto thermostat is a nice feature, I prefer the latter. Great heater, quick output, great price. Highly recommend.",

      "review_title": "Wow!  Now this is a Space Heater",
      "review_comment": "In sticking to my policy of reviewing products that are either exceptional or a waste of money, this bad boy warrants an immediate review. Holy Crow! Exceptional! Now I know how a space heater is supposed to work. I've been loyal to a Lasko model 754200 for years, purchasing it 2-3 times in the last 9 years. After cleaning it the other day it stopped producing hot air on the low setting, AGAIN! And the high setting was nothing to write home about. This has happened before and I am sick of it. So, I searched, compared, read reviews and selected this Dreo model DR-HSH006. I never expected such fantastic results. This thing is great! It isn't a fan blowing out warmish air, it's putting out HEAT! Serious heat! I ran it for an hour this morning and the temp in my living room increased from 71 to 77 degrees! WOW! That has NEVER happened before. My HVAC doesn't even warm my place up like that! Additionally, I ran it because I got soaked from the rain. I set my shoes, socks and pants in front of it and in less than an hour they are all dry! And it wasn't even on the highest setting! It was on the middle setting H2. The Lasko would take hours to dry my shoes! Inside and out! Took less than an hour for Dreo! The model itself is a round, black colored unit, with push-buttons on top to operate. I was concerned about breakage with buttons instead of dials, but the buttons are so sensitive (not in a bad way) that just a light push or tap, or a Jedi Mind Trick garners results. Indeed, as other reviewers state, the buttons are hard to see in a poorly lit room, and they could use a white outline or illumination to see them better. However, with the results I've gotten I'll accept that trade-off. But Dreo, for next year's model make that change, customers will thank you. And Lasko, go back to the drawing board and do whatever these Dreo guys did, because you just got crushed, badly! In additon, I like the timer feature, and since this bad boy does such an effective job blasting out heat that timer is a great feature so I won't awaken to a sauna. Also, I would lay on the floor and camp in front of my Lasko to get warmed up. The heat discharge was a straight line, but not this unit. The Dreo has an expaded heat disharge zone in comparison. You can even feel it standing near the unit. Can't do that with Lasko, you'd have to be directly in front of it. Because this Dreo heats up the space so quickly and effectively, I've not even needed to fiddle with the temp setting, I can run it for a few minutes and presto, it's warm enough that I can turn the unit off. This unit will save me oodles on the electric and gas costs to run my HVAC, supplanting the need to run the HVAC so frequently. And it will save me even more electric bill money because I don't need to run this heater for hours for effective results like with my former Lasko model. Assuming nothing chages in the future, and no buttons break, or malfunctions occur, I highly recommend this space heater.",

Es un maravilloso producto, es estético, no hace nada de ruido, vivo en Cdmx y en días súper fríos basta con poner la función de Heat 1 y con eso es suficiente para calentar toda la habitación o sala. El diseño esta hermoso! Ocupa poco espacio y cabe en todos lados, trae un cable largo y no pesa. Estamos muy contentas con nuestra compra y a pesar de que tuvimos que pagar la importación vale cada peso este producto, lo recomiendo muchísimo, definitivamente es de los mejores que hay, los más modernos.",
