  "customers_say": "Customers find the fan powerful for its size, moving lots of air with a strong breeze, and appreciate its quiet operation and compact design that's perfect for small rooms. They consider it good value for money and praise its quality. However, the functionality receives mixed feedback, with some saying it works well while others report it stops working. Moreover, durability is a concern as multiple customers report the motor burning out after one month of use.",

      "review_comment": "I waited to make a review because I saw a few people saying it doesn't last long, but I can say after having mine for 3 years, it is definitely a hardy little fan. After 3 years it still blows with the same strength as when I got it, it comes with 3 levels, I have it on the lowest every night when I sleep and it's still a decent amount of airflow. I keep this fan on for hours at a time, literally all night every night, and I have been for years and it's still going strong. The noise level in my opinion, it's reasonable for the size and speed it's blowing at. At the lowest setting, it's at the foot of my bed and has a soft whirling that creates a white noise that at this point helps me sleep. Higher levels definitely have a louder noise but I've never needed to use anything other than the lowest setting. It's easy to use, just plug it in and turn it on. The switch is a little counterintuitive though because it goes backwards, the farthest level is the lowest and the first is the strongest. It's overall very lightweight, and you can move and aim the fan up or down to adjust airflow (doesn't move side to side, but it's small enough you can turn the whole thing). It is made of hard plastic, and looks exactly like the picture. When I bought it, it was $15, not sure if the price has changed since then, but considering rhe price, it's an outstanding little fan, and I definitely recommend it. Not a huge financial commitment either if you for some reason end up not liking it.",

The fan feels compact yet effective, and the airflow it produces seems decent for a fan of this size. I also appreciate the adjustable angle lets me direct the air exactly where I need it, and the three speed settings make it easy to customize the cooling. On the downside, the fan is a bit noisier than I expected, especially on the higher speeds, so it’s something to consider if you’re using it in a bedroom or office where quiet is important. Still, for its price and portability, I think it’s a practical choice if you need a small, moveable fan that delivers solid airflow.",

The sound is not loud and is enough to cancel out ambient noises so I can sleep. Yeah, I know it sounds crazy but when it is \"too quiet\" I can't sleep and any other sounds will snap me out of my sleep. The fan works well for moving air and does a reasonable job at helping keep the room from getting stuffy on a hot day. Don't look for it to move huge volumes of air, the fan is not designed for that. I have been impressed that during 2 Summers now when hot out, this fan runs 24hrs a day. When not hot outside, I run it at night for about 8hrs. That is a LOT of time for the bearings to run and they have performed excellent. It would be interesting to calculate the distance it would have travelled if you took the dimensions of the bearing hub and figure out how many inches of travel in one full 360 degree rotation of the hub. Then multiply by how many full rotations happen per second, then times 60 to equal a minute, then times 60 for an hour then times the average time it has run in a year! LOL...my point is, this little fan has likely spun for thousands of miles on those bearings in 2 years without overheating and it is still going strong! Pretty good for an inexpensive fan when you really think about the wear and durability!",
