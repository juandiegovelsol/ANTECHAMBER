      "review_comment": "I'm not sure about the thermostat as it's never shut off on its own while using the heat (it doesn't turn on for the fan unless the thermostat thing is set at a certain point though). It does get a bit warm but nothing disturbingly so. I have a small living room and kitchen - in the living room I'll put it across from the electric fireplace and turn it on and in no time my cold basement suite is a nice toasty 75. It's a little noisy but not overbearing. In the kitchen I'll put it on one side and another smaller space heater on the other and my kitchen, which is always cold, warms up in about 15 minutes and stays warm long enough for me to cook some food. My basement suite loses heat rather quickly (landlord's special) but running this for 5-10 minutes warms it up enough to be comfortable. I also like that it has a fan - since my kitchen doesn't have a vent or ventilation of any sort, I open the window in my living room, set this fan at the window and aim it towards the kitchen, and set another fan on the oven and force air from outside through the house and into the bathroom which does have a fan and ventilation. It's powerful enough to send the air across the living room. Would recommend. It's a good heater.",

      "review_comment": "So this heater is small in size but works amazing. I have it sitting on a dresser in my babies room. We’re in a basement suite and it gets chilly sometimes. This heater heats up a large room within a couple minutes. You can adjust to how much heat you want coming out at once as well as the temperature dial. Once the room heats up to the temp you adjusted it to, it will turn off. And it will turn back on when the temperature drops. The safety feature is amazing as well, the second it’s picked up, moved, or tilted in the slightest it cuts all power. So you don’t have the risk of it falling onto something while blowing heat and causing damage or fire. It also doubles as a fan and blows non heated air if you want as well.",
