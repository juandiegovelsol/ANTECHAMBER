      "review_comment": "Update after 1.5 years: Had an issue where one earbud would stop charging, or rarely charge. First happened at 6 months. Exchanged under warranty. One year later, having the same issue. I have liked them. They have good sound and are easy to use. But I would not order them again. I might be a fool, but I'm looking at buying one of their other models. Mostly because I'm looking for a good brand name that isn't $200. Side note: JBL was great about the warranty and shipped the replacement pods quickly. Update after 5 months of use: A quick update of the ear buds. The charging of the ear buds is fast. Going from \"low battery\" to full takes a short amount of time. I think a minute or two. Never timed it. A couple of issues: * Taking calls on it is hit or miss. Often the headphones will get out of sync and it will do a weird binaural thing where it will alternate between each ear getting cut out for a split second back and forth for about two seconds. This can happen multiple times in a minute. * Over a bit of time of playback, the earphones will cut out for about 2-3 seconds. I'm not sure why. Maybe some sort of sync issue? More annoying when listening to an audio book than music. Original Review: This review is for: JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), Small Overall, I like them. Video mode has no audio lag. They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips. I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case. Highs: * When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice). * Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate. I haven't had them accidently double activate so far. * Video mode has no audio/video lag. Must be enabled in the app. By default it is set to Music mode. * Good sound. They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips. * Fit is good. Three sizes for sealed tips. * Can setup each touch control to a different command set. * Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app. * Has a \"find earphones\" function (only when still turned on). Emits a tone and is easy to hear. * Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC. For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled. If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning. * Good Bluetooth range. Lows: * Hard to get out of the case. This seems to be common with all case based small headphones. There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out. * When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over. (Skip, play, pause, volume up.) * No way to turn on the earphones without the case. Not even with the app. Cannot force standby either. * This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly. The app can turn off the earphones. * Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off. With or without the sealed tips. But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones. Other: To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body. The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",

      "review_comment": "I’ve been using the JBL Tune Flex earbuds for a bit now, and overall, they deliver solid sound quality for the price. The bass is punchy, and the mids and highs come through clearly, which makes them enjoyable for a variety of music styles. The active noise cancellation helps reduce background noise in quieter settings, but it’s not very strong in louder environments. Comfort-wise, they feel okay for shorter listening sessions, but I noticed that wearing them for too long can get a bit uncomfortable, and I’ve heard from others that some people experience ear irritation after extended use. Battery life is impressive, with the earbuds and charging case providing many hours of playback before needing a recharge. Bluetooth connectivity is generally stable and easy to set up, though I have had the occasional disconnect or charging hiccup. Call quality is decent for casual chatting, but background noise can sometimes make conversations harder to hear. Overall, the JBL Tune Flex earbuds offer good value if you want solid sound and features on a budget, but if comfort or consistent connection is a top priority, they might not be perfect for everyone.",

Whether I’m listening to music, watching a movie, or taking a call, everything sounds clean and balanced. The Bluetooth connection is solid and quick to pair with my phone and laptop. Battery life is great — I’ve gotten several days of use on a single charge, even with daily listening. One of the standout features is the comfort. The ear cushions are super soft and don’t hurt my ears even after hours of wear. They also do a pretty good job of blocking out background noise, even without active noise canceling. Overall, JBL delivers exactly what you’d expect — quality, durability, and awesome sound. Highly recommend for music lovers, commuters, or anyone who needs reliable wireless headphones!",

      "review_comment": "I've had these earbuds now for two years. Pros: The sound quality is decent, the noise cancelling is decent, and and battery life is good (typically only need to charge every other day, even with prolonged use). They are also pretty comfortable to leave in for hours with the selection of tip sizes. They also stay secure in my ears while running or working out in the gym. Cons: Only connect to one device at a time. The touch control options can be frustrating and are unintuitive (why can I tap to answer a call but not to hang up?) the buds and the case seem to be designed to be impossible to hold on to. The shape of the buds and case coupled with the matte finish make them liable to squirt out of your fingers every time you pick them up or put them down. They also have a bad habit of connecting to my phone at random while stored in the case while sitting in my pocket or on the counter. This is annoying as I will discover they have been connected for hours killing the battery or that my podcast has been playing for an hour.",

      "review_comment": "I'm using it almost every day for a year, and it's much better than my previous JBL earphones that died after 6 months. It connects fastly to the phone and get a lot of different settings. Unfortunately, lately there have been sudden interruptions in the sound for a couple of seconds, which is sometimes annoying. Also, with time of use, the volume in the earphones weakens, which is generally normal. The battery holds a charge just as well. Good bass and clear sound, I think this is one of the most successful models of in-ear headphones in the last couple of years.",
