    "review_comment": "I was looking at gaming mice from the big brands and just couldn't stomach the high prices. I saw this Redragon mouse, and for the cost, I figured it was worth a shot. I am absolutely blown away. The sensor feels responsive and accurate in the games I play, the programmable side buttons are a huge quality-of-life improvement, and the RGB lighting looks fantastic. This honestly feels and performs like a mouse that should cost three times as much. An incredible, unbeatable value.",

    "review_comment": "feels great to hold. i haven’t charged this ever (i purchased it a week and a half ago), and it’s currently on half battery. so, the battery life is amazing. the build quality is fine, nothing feels cheap. i like that you can customize what each button does in the software, but you have to go searching on the internet to download the software, it doesn’t install when you connect the mouse like how razer products do.\n\nmouse doesn’t weigh a lot, feels smooth. the mouse has never disconnected on me randomly, and it’s nice how it’ll turn off the rgb lights after 1 minute of no use to save battery. i haven’t had any problems with the accuracy. my old mouse used to not register on fast movements so i couldn’t play shooter games, but this one works like a charm.",

    "review_comment": "This wasn't a planned purchase, but I needed a mouse to play some PC games with, and I was looking specifically for ones that happened to have a lot of programmable buttons. Enter this mouse. Not only is it very comfortable for someone with large hands like myself, but it looks really nice on top of having great functionality. One of my favorite things about this mouse is the fact that it has a re-chargable battery, meaning that the days of me having to buy batteries for my controller are over. The middle button light will change colors depending on the battery life - green is fully charged, blue is mid-life, and red is dying.\n\nBattery life is incredible, with me really only having to charge this thing once a week on average. That said, I also turn off the mouse when it's not in use, which likely extends the life of the battery quite a bit. Wireless connectivity is great, both through bluetooth or the included dongle, and I appreciate the fact that there's a nice space on the inside of the mouse to store the dongle when not in use.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing quality mouse for the price, as well as the eight reprogrammable buttons. This is perfect for someone who needs to be able to program hotkeys for specific games and programs, and the assistant program even allows you to create different button profiles that you can load at will.",

    "review_comment": "I'm giving this one four stars only because I accidentally hit the thumb button that executes back function in Windows sometimes.  I never had that problem with my older Logitech G300s gaming mouse.\n\nThe mouse looks and feels decent enough.  The scroll wheel doesn't take excessive force to scroll like some low cost mice.  It was one of the cheapest gaming mice and I'm satisfied with how it works for the price.  It feels good in my hand which is pretty large, but might be too large for someone with a small hand like a child.  I haven't noticed that it makes my hand sweaty or anything like that.  The cable has a braided sheath that probably won't crack in half the way solid plastic cable sheaths sometimes do when they get old and brittle.  I don't think it has as many buttons as my G300s did, but I don't really use the extra buttons on the mouse in the games I play.  I think perhaps if you play MMOs you could benefit from more buttons.  I play lots of games, but they are not first-person shooters or twitch games so I can't comment on the high-speed performance as the games I play just aren't that demanding.  It is definitely more performant than the Logitech B100 desktop mouse I had used since my G300s gaming mouse stopped working as the B100 mouse had a very slow polling rate definitely not adequate for twitch gaming.",

    "review_comment": "Best mouse for it's price point. Able to customize every button. Setting up macros in the program has a learning curve, but easy to do once you understand the basics. Was able to set the trigger button to right click 300 times a second. This mouse can register multiple button presses at once, great for those games where you need to press 2+ buttons at the same time. The usb/power/connector wire is made from a soft cloth like texture. I assume it might offer less protection (but unless you're gaming next to sharp objects, not an issue) than a braided plastic cord, but the softness allows fluidity and lets you slide the mouse better without pull back from the wire. LED is neat and customizable in the program, but eventually you might want to turn it off. Mouse able to turn off LED. Once you program your buttons you also don't need to constantly keep the program open like some other mice, so less resources on your machine. A+ for it's price point, would buy again.",
