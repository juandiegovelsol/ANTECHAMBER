    "review_comment": "This was my third Stanley water bottle purchase. Great design! The flip up lid makes one-handed operation easy - bought one for my nephew who lost his right arm - he loves it! The lid closes in a manner that covers the drinking area, keeping it clean (like when you drop the bottle ion the trail...) Keeps water ice-cold for hours. Easy to carry with the handle - also fits in any cup holder.\nLids are NOT sold separately, so when it will no longer flips open, it seems you have to buy another bottle...",

    "review_comment": "What a nice water bottle! I totally love it.  It fits in my console, cup holder and is easy to carry.  The lilac color is a very nice.  The bottle is very durable and has a nice safety latch to keep the lid closed in case the button is pressed by accident. It keeps your drink Hot/ or Cold at least 10hrs. in my experience, maybe longer but that's how long I use it. I recommend this bottle!",

    "review_comment": "I recently added the Stanley Quick Flip GO 24 oz Water Bottle (Azure) to my gear, and it’s quickly become a staple.\n\nWhat I love:\n • One-handed use: The push-button lid flips open instantly and locks securely—convenient when you’re on the move.\n • Leak-proof confidence: It seals tightly, so I stash it in my bag without any worries about spills.\n • Great insulation: Keeps liquid refreshingly cold throughout the day or warm for hours—perfect for long activities.\n • Durable design: The stainless steel build is lightweight yet feels solid—ready for travel or workouts.\n • Travel-friendly: Its slim, packable shape fits seamlessly into side pockets or commuter backpacks.\n\nJust one small note: The lid’s hinge might feel stiff at first, but it loosens nicely after a few uses.\n\nThis bottle strikes a great balance between functionality, durability, and convenience. It’s become my go-to for hydration at the gym, on hikes, and during daily commutes.",

I have bought many Stanley thermoses over the years and they have all performed beautifully. This company stands behind its products and fully resolved a customer service matter that I had.  I would never buy from any other company because Stanley makes the best products.",

Drinking from it is great with good flow. Keeps cold for more than 24 hours. Super easy to clean. The included handle is very helpful to carry it anywhere.",
