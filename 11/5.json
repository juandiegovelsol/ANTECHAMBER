      "review_comment": "This air fryer is ideal for smaller kitchens or only feeding a couple people. The small footprint is easy to find space for and it does fit under cabinets no problem, without even needing to pull it out to access the controls. The basket holds about 2L, I only fill half full so there is room to shake things around in the basket. I like it for fries, chicken strips, even reheating a slice of pizza. There is a removable insert tray that lets air circulate underneath for even cooking. That makes cleaning easier for me as well. The whole basket is non-stick and easy to just wipe clean but it is dishwasher safe and fully washable. The one-touch controls cover most of my needs making operation as simple as pressing one button most of the time. For times I need to tweak the time and temperature, I can do that as well. I love this machine when cooking for myself. It heats quick, cooks fast and makes great, crispy food.",

It’s compact enough to fit perfectly in my small kitchen, but still powerful enough to whip up a crispy batch of fries or perfectly cooked chicken in no time. The FryForce 360° tech works great—everything comes out evenly cooked with that golden crunch, and I barely use any oil. The 10 one-touch presets are super convenient and take the guesswork out of cooking. I’ve tried several already—Fries, Bake, and Reheat—and they’ve all delivered great results. The digital display is clean and easy to use, and I love that it has built-in safety features like auto shut-off and overheat protection. Cleanup is a breeze too. The basket and tray pop right out and go straight into the dishwasher. If you're cooking for one or two people, this is a solid, affordable option that doesn't take over your counter. Great value and I use it almost daily!",

Only get this size if you are doing meals for a single person or a couple. This would not be appropriate for family meals. Every thing I have cooked in it has come out perfectly cooked each time. I like that it comes with a cooking guide as to how much time is needed for different foods. It's super easy to clean even if you don't line it. It preheat quickly, it gives alerts and reminders on the display to add food or turn food or to say that the food is done. Which is great because it's relatively quiet and I can be a lil forgetful.",

The presets make it feel fancier than it is, and I love not having to guess how long to cook my sweet potato fries. That said, if you’re trying to feed more than one hungry person, it fills up fast. I’ve definitely had to do a second batch more than once. But for someone who lives alone and refuses to eat soggy microwave food, it’s been a pretty solid upgrade.

I would say it's durable because it stood up to several road trips and being hauled in and out of airbnbs and hotels. The controls are straightforward works just basically like any other air fryer I've ever used. Almost as fast as a microwave when reheating something. This really can save your leftover waffle fries from being tossed, lol.
