      "review_comment": "We have had our Adventure Press for 8 months now. It has performed flawlessly and makes great coffee (we like it strong!). It takes about 7 minutes from boiling of the water (we use an induction plate at home and in RV) to coffee: boil water, place three heaping coffee scoops of pre-ground dark roast from Trader Joe’s - YUM, stir till all grounds are wet and you see the crema, cover and set timer for 4 minutes and press. Voila. Enough to make two Yeti 14 oz mugs of coffee! Delicious! I have a brush I use to brush the grounds from the bottom of the press and a stiff silicone spatula to scoop out the grounds in bottom of pot. Easy to make another pot if we want more or make less by splitting 14 oz between us. We LOVE it for our RV as coffee grounds are my nemesis. Everything we have used gets grounds everywhere and I don’t want them in my RV tank. I have perfected almost zero grounds with the above method. We have talked about getting another one for the house as I keep bringing it in for coffee at home! Well made, light, durable, and I think of myself as somewhat of a coffee snob (other than I don’t grind my own beans……yet!) For the price, get 1 or 2!!!!",

      "review_comment": "Cool little piece of kit for those caffeine addicts. I really like this french press/pot. I have no doubt that the stainless pot will hold up for years, but I'm not sure long term how the nylon parts will hold up, especially since we cook over open fires in sometimes windy conditions. Only time will tell, I have about 6 different coffee making apparatus for camping , from Biolite, 2 Aeropress, old school enamel percolator, etc but so far this is my favorite. It's not perfect but it is robust, is simple and makes a few good cups of coffee at a time with good filtering. If I were to gripe (or add some design requests) I would include a stainless lid that can be used over an open fire in place of the nylon lid. I actually tried the lid from the STANLEY Adventure The Nesting Two Cup Cookset, and it kind of worked but the lid doesnt really fit but sort of sits in the top of the pot precariously via friction. It helps water to boil faster and over open fires near the ocean, keeps sand and ash from blowing in. I also might think about using the french press idea from the biolite press. Seems like it could save some space and weight. This is also a great size for backpacking, its a hair under 1 LT but bigger than a lot of the other ones out there, plus its stainless so you can use it just about anywhere. Over all this is a great pot for those who aren't counting grams and want a pot/coffee press that can stand up to a lot of abuse and shine in multiple scenarios.",

Because of my previous experiences with Stanley products, I was pretty sure this 32oz French press would quickly become another favorite that we could use on our RV adventures. True to form, this Stanley French press makes great coffee. The filter is absolutely great and the resulting coffee has almost no grounds in it. There is a water line marker inside the French press that makes it very easy to make the perfect pot of great tasting coffee without a scale. The french press pot can be placed on direct heat to boil water while camping, thus making this French Press very portable. Since we travel in an RV, we boil the water for our French press in an electric kettle and have discovered that the stainless steel pot gets very, very hot and must be handled with extreme caution. Like all Stanley products, this French press is very durable.",

If you add a clean food approved sponge to the mix or even a coffee filter you can filter out the coffee even more it’s honestly the best thing. This Stanly coffee maker does not only work for coffee but it works to make teas too. Know that the quality isn’t cheap either. It’s pure stainless steel and you’ll have no problem washing and cleaning. I’d say put it under fire by removing the sticker that’s under the coffee press. Put in heat/low heat after removing the sticker, I say put in fire to remove any type of stress from the steel or bacteria even if you washed or rinsed off.

Mas ela funciona muito bem para coar o café. Uso está em substituição a uma prensa francesa de vidro, e acho mais durável que a de vidro. Recomendo muito.",

I was so happy the coffee tasted so good even my wife who hardly drinks coffee liked the coffee when she tried it. The coffee tasted much like our very own \"kapeng barako\" which I enjoyed in the hilly towns of the Philippines. Now I'm so excited to share brewed coffee to my friends with this Stanley French press.",

Well built, with a French press second to none. No grinds escaped, made 3 full cups for the morning and then used it to make hot breakfast. It was often the only cook item I took (except longer trips). Lots of storage for camp kitchen items while travelling, great for soup, rice, noodles and steamed veggies to boot! Can’t say enough good things about this item. As someone else mentioned, handles can get hot if cooking on open fire, so make sure you have gloves or something.",
