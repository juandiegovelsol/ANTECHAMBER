      "review_title": "Fantastic breakfast sandwich maker",
      "review_comment": "I was kind of skeptical about this thing but am having such a good experience with it. Easy breakfast sandwiches and incredibly easy clean up. If you're like me and hate reading directions, don't overlook that each sandwich apparatus pops out and removes from the main griddle machine for easy cleaning. I didn't notice this until I went through a couple of messy clean ups and it made all the difference. I like spraying a little bit of Pam in the bottom which aids greatly in reducing sticking and improves clean up. Very enjoyable sandwich machine and I'm finding myself using it almost daily. Great recipes on their website. Good bang for your buck considering the utility and low cost. Tips: 1) Don't overload the top tray. Just put as little as possible on top of the egg. If you load stuff in the top tray and then close it, the weight and pressure will push the egg through the seams and you'll get runny egg on the base of the griddle plate making clean up more difficult. I just put cheese on top of the egg, wait about 20 seconds and then gently lay the top muffin/mini bagel and gently let the top tray rest on top and I rarely get egg running out the sides. ***Also, take a fork and pierce the egg yolk so that it flattens out. This will also cause less pressure from a non uniform surface. 2) Go easy on the cheese. Too much cheese will just make a mess. 3) A little bit of Pam spray on the top tray lets the bottom slide release much smoother. I heat mine up while I'm getting everything ready. I let 20-30 secs go by before I put the cheese on top of the egg and this allows it to start cooking and I have much less running from the seams. 4.5 minutes and the sandwich is perfect. Love this gadget. I never knew I'd use it as much as I do and it's become an almost daily part of my breakfast routine.",

      "review_comment": "I was looking for something that my tween could use to make himself a breakfast sandwich before school. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I like that the bottom bread, we use english muffins, gets nice and crispy. The top bread does not get that same crispiness but does warm up. We mostly use frozen sausage patties for our sandwiches and have found that we have to warm them up per the directions on the bag before adding to the sandwich maker. It doesn't seem to warm them up on it's own. It's not a big inconvenience though, we throw them into the microwave while the sandwich maker is warming up. It is an extra step we didn't think we would have to do before buying though. We typically butter the bottom bread, then cheese, then sausage to finish up the bottom layer. This way the cheese does not melt onto the sliding plate. We make sure to spray the sliding section for the egg with non stick spray as well. We do not butter the top bread as it seems to keep the egg from cooking all the way, or within our set time. We usually do 4.5 mins. Overall we do like this cooker, it does make a quick sandwich pretty easy. We have tried it with bagels but some bagels are too big to fit into rings and the ones that do fit may have to be trimmed down due to being too thick for the rings to close. Just an FYI if you like bagel sandwiches. I do not regret adding this sandwich maker to my kitchen gadgets.",

      "review_title": "You don't need this, but if you like English muffin and egg sandwiches you'll be glad you have it!",
      "review_comment": "My first reaction to seeing this product was \"they sorta went overboard on this\", i.e., why design it do make the entire sandwich when the meat has to be precooked anyway ... it seemed to me that just cooking a pair of properly-sized eggs would be a big help, and would be a much simpler machine (although it wouldn't pre-melt the cheese). But my wife and I like breakfast sandwiches and this machine makes two at a time, which is better than using my tiny egg skillet, so I decided to give it a shot. After using it several times, my original reaction has been confirmed, but I'm still happy I have it, and I'm assigning 5 stars because it is a well-made product that performs exactly as advertised. As others have stated, I'm not a fan of the manufacturer's recommended process of plopping everything into the preheated machine (including placing the top of the English muffin onto the raw egg) and setting it to cook for 5 minutes. Rather, I prefer to cook just the egg for a while, and then add everything else. The total cook time is still 5 minutes, the upper muffin hasn't soaked up a bunch of the egg, and the cheese (which should be placed directly onto the lower muffin half, not on top of the meat!) is nicely melted without running off the sides of the sandwich. Cleanup is very easy, as advertised (if it wasn't, we would already have written this machine off and tossed it into a closet). The resulting food quality is quite good ... the muffins are a little chewy compared to toasting them, but it's a reasonable trade-off to get the cheese nicely melted and everything heated properly without getting out other appliances or pans.",

I really like this breakfast sandwich maker, so hoping it does not suffer the same fate. If you use a tiny bit of cooking spray and spread it with a paper towel there is really no clean up other than wiping it down with a slightly soapy cloth and repeating with a clean moist cloth. The sandwiches are great. Really tasty and unlike a fast food place you can choose to add salt or not. I'd say you can make this breakfast sandwich as healthy as you want to be. One thing I would say is that the maker basically fuses the sandwich together so if you want ketchup or any other topic you need to add it at the beginning as I think you would make a mess to break apart the sandwich to add toppings I find 4.5 min cooking time is best.",
