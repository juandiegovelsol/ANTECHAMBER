      "review_comment": "When I used this pot for the first time, I wanted to fry a sun egg on a whim. I was a little worried that it would be a mess like before. As a result, the egg slipped down and formed obediently in the pot. When turning over, it was even a little easy to surprise. From that day on, I used it for breakfast. I almost didn't need oil. The eggs I made were full of aroma, and of course there were ham slices. I am very satisfied that its non stick pot material is well processed. Children say that the dishes it makes are better than those bought outside. On weekends, I also use it to stir fry vegetables or fry fish. The heat is just right, and there will be no half-burnt and half raw. Of course, the fish won't stick to the pot either. After dinner, I am no longer afraid of washing the pot. I just rinse it and it will be clean. Now, every time I walk into the kitchen and pick up this pot, I feel that cooking has become pleasant and comfortable, as if I have a little more happiness in life.",

      "review_comment": "I received a 10 inch hammered finish frying pan with Stainless Steel on the bottom and nonstick on the cooking surface. This pan looks great and cooks well. The hammered finish gives it a nice look, and it feels solid and just the right weight in my hand, not too heavy at all. I followed the instruction and seasoned it before using. Nothing sticks to it, cleanup is super easy. I’ve made eggs, handmade pancakes, and some hashbrowns in it, and they came out great. It works fine on my gas stove, and I like that it can go in the oven too if I need it to. The handle stays cool enough to hold, and the size is perfect for our small family's everyday use. It heats up quickly and doesn’t warp or wobble. It’s just a simple, well-made pan that does what it’s supposed to. I use it almost every day, and it’s been wonderful so far.",

I used ir cooking a couple of ribeye steaks. I like its evenly the pan heated. It’s made of stainless steel with no coating (free from PFOA, PFAS, lead, and cadmium), it still nonstick-like performance once the pan was properly preheated. The steaks seared beautifully, developed a perfect crust, and slid right off the surface without sticking. And the pan is oven-safe, I was able to transfer it straight into the oven to finish cooking. Cleaning is easy by hand or dishwasher. Pros: - Sturdy, heavy-duty stainless steel build - 100% free from harmful coatings (PFOA, PFAS, lead, cadmium) - Provides excellent nonstick performance - Oven-safe, versatile for stovetop-to-oven cooking - 12-inch size is perfect for steaks, chicken, or family meals",

The look is beautiful, that hammered texture makes it feel like something from a fancy kitchen, it’s sturdy enough for daily cooking. What surprised me is how even the heat spreads, I can sauté vegetables or sear chicken without worrying about hot spots. The surface is smooth and nonstick enough for eggs to slide right off, it still gives a nice browning. Cleaning is easy too, I just rinse it and wipe with a soft sponge, no scrubbing needed. I’ve even used it in the oven for baked pasta, it came out great. It works well on my induction cooktop and heats up fast.",

I’ve done everything from fried eggs to thick cuts of steak, and it handled both without issues. Being able to start on the stove and finish in the oven at higher temps adds flexibility, especially when cooking meats that need a sear before baking. I also like not worrying about toxic coatings, which was a big reason I switched. Food still slides off easily, and I don’t spend forever scrubbing.",
