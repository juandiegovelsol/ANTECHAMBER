      "review_comment": "Initial review - I won't be addressing reliability over time as this item is new to me. This is an improvement over my 5+ year old induction plate. Things I like: 1) the temperature monitoring of the cookware being heated seems more responsive. My previous induction cooktop would begin to boil small amounts of water even with the temperature set to 140 degrees, at least for a couple minutes, before reducing power to maintain 140 degrees. 2) while the cooling fan inside the unit is certainly not silent, is isn't as loud as my older unit and seems to have multiple speeds - higher when the power or temperature is higher, slower (slightly less sound) when the power or temperature are lower, slow during the cool-down period. 3) the readout shows 'hot' when the surface has been heated by hot cookware on top - in the time between uses, I now know if the surface has cooled. There are a good number of function options, so your choices may take a few button presses to accomplish. They are mostly easy to learn - not a problem if you actually want a good number of presets and options. If this unit remains reliable, I won't need to return for an edit :-)",

That’s why I bought this induction cooktop, and it’s been great. It has multiple power settings and modes for things like boiling water or cooking, plus a timer function. It boils water quickly, cooks noodles faster, and I love that the handles don’t get hot at all. Some reviews mentioned it can be noisy, but compared to other appliances I own, it’s not that loud. I also like that it’s slimmer and lighter than similar models.",

I have turned both skillets in various directions, always with the same result. Drop an egg in the upper half and it will fry up quickly, drop one in the lower portion, and it basically just sits there. Does the same when I cooked some hamburgers, and pancakes. After the grease should be sufficiently hot, flicking some water in it gives a definite response in the upper quadrant, but little reaction in the other half. The instructions are uninformative. Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but I never had a similar problem with a gas stove/burner. I don't like the conventional electric burners, because they tend to warp, and the skillets/pots have to be set off of the burners because they retain heat, which this thing requires also. The choices/options for cooking are far more 'sophisticated' than necessary, and choosing the wrong option may be part of the problem I'm having, but there is nothing I've found that even addresses my problem with this device.",

The controls are easy to use and the timer is a helpful feature. It does not take up much space and storing it is no problem. My wife also likes it enough that she wants to get another one for our rental unit. Overall, it is a good and practical cooktop for everyday use.",

I mostly use it for heating water fast in a pan for making tea, etc. It is very rapid at heating. Also provides various other heating functions (which I haven't really used to be honest as I have a new oven now). Doesn't take up much room either, when not in use I stow it under a kitchen cabinet and cover with a tea towel!. Recommended.",

      "review_comment": "Works really well. Even a couple of pots that I was unsure would respond to induction because they seemed poorly magnetic worked perfectly fine with this induction unit. It heats up so quickly and responds to changes in temperature settings quickly. I much prefer it to our gas cooktop and use it every day. I just wish more of my pots were induction compatible particularly my pressure cooker. I use it every day for a steamer for my plant based milks for my coffee and it is better than gas because it keeps the heat up without the heat coming around the side of the pot which burns my hands when I am steaming the milk. I just used it to make a batch of beer and it heats a 5 gallon pot of water in about 15 minutes whereas my gas cooktop struggles with that volume. I can also take it outside and cook my beer in the garage which makes for a more harmonious domestic situation. I love this thing.",
