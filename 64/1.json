      "review_title": "Very nice pans - great value",
      "review_comment": "I've been waiting a while to review this set - I wanted to really use the pans first. Plus this is my first time using stainless steel cookware, so I had a learning curve to master. While, I definitely haven't mastered everything, I've made a lot of progress. Coming from non-stick everything, I had to learn how to cook without sticking everything, and mostly I have. I have learned the joys of getting a good sear on meat and deglazing to make a delicious pan sauce, and how nice it is to have skillets and a Dutch oven that can be used in the oven. However, I am glad that the small skillet included in the set is non-stick, since I still need a non-stick skillet for eggs. The pans have some heft, but are not too heavy to comfortably handle. They feel very sturdy with their riveted handles. Due to the heavy, cladded bottom, these pans heat very evenly, and once they are hot, they hold a lot of heat - so the pan temperature doesn't drop as much when you add cold food to your hot pan. They have nice flat bottoms so they are great for smooth top stoves. I love the glass lids, so you can see what's going on inside without opening the lids. The handles on the pots and pans stay cool for quite a while when cooking on the stovetop. Eventually they do get warm - if you cook something a long time, expect the handles to be hot. The handles on the lids heat up more quickly, so unless the lid has been on the pan for just a couple of minutes, you should assume that you'll need a pot holder to open the lid. Speaking of lids, although there are only five lids, there is a pot lid that will fit each skillet, so you have a lid to fit any pot/pan. I found the included 2 qt saucepan awkward for cooking/heating small quantities, so I bought the Cuisinart 8919-14 Professional Stainless Saucepan with Cover, 1-Quart later. That size is perfect for those little jobs. For most people, I think that is the only pot you really need to add to this set. I had wondered whether the 4qt saute pan would be big enough for stir fries and such for my family of 5. The answer is yes, it's big enough - but just barely. If you cook more than 6 servings you may want to purchase the Cuisinart 89336-30H Professional Stainless Saute with Cover, 6-Quart separately. I really wish that Cuisinart offered the option to purchase the set with either the 4 qt or the 6 qt. I only hand wash the small non-stick skillet to preserve its non-stick surface. I also use only non-metal utensils with the non-stick skillet. However, the other pots and pans clean up nicely in the dishwasher. In the event of stubborn food stains, water spots, or rainbow haze, you can renew their new pot shine with Barkeeper's Friend. Although the manual that came with the pans said that superficial scratches caused by using metal utensils on the pots and pans (other than the non-stick) would not affect their usability, I still avoid metal utensils so I don't scratch them up and they stay looking nice. All in all, I am very pleased with this set. I think this is a great value - with the heavy cladded bottoms on this set I am getting most of the benefits of fully-cladded stainless steel at a fraction of the cost of All-Clad. I hope that these pots and pans will last a lifetime (except the non-stick skillet, since non-stick coatings always seem to wear out).",

      "review_comment": "This cookware is very beautiful and cooks beautifully as long as you don't turn the heat past medium high, unless you are boiling something in lots of water, like pasta. I have a glass-top stove and they are very responsive to my burners. It does take slightly longer for the pans to get hot initially, but that's because I never turn the heat past medium high. I hand-wash my pans instead of putting them in the dishwasher because I want them to stay shiny . If anything sticks to the pan, just add water and let it soak for a half hour. A soft dishcloth with a nylon mesh backing is perfect for getting rid of any discoloration (like after you cook rice) and returning the pans to their shiny state. I added the 1-qt. kettle to my set and am considering adding the 12-inch frying pan. The smallest frying pan has a non-stick surface (not Teflon) that is very durable and is great for frying eggs. I mostly use nylon utensils but occasionally use metal ones and have not noticed any scratches. I stack my pans and have not seen any scratches from that either. I've had the pans for about six months and they look brand new. The lid handles do get hot (the pan handles do not), so you have to use a hot pad when picking up the lids.",

Even heat distribution (I have an induction range top) and nice any heavy so you can use them without the annoying wobble that cheap pans from big box stores have in common. With proper use and care (please goggle how to properly use and care for stainless steel cookware prior to purchasing) they will last a lifetime! For the price, you just can't beat it if you're serious about cooking!",

They cook evenly and quickly on my new induction stove. Oven safe and beautiful to look at hanging on a pot rack. I recommend this rack for the lids [...]I cook several times every day and the pots are getting some spots on the inside bottom. I don't mind in the least, but thought I'd mention for the sake of a complete review. The spots seem to happen in the dishwasher, so maybe handwashing consistently would prevent that.",

I was drawn to this set for the look, the fact that it is kind to glass top stoves, and the majority of great reviews. I am so very pleased with myself for selecting this set as I love it! It came quickly, was very well packaged, and looks fabulous hanging in my kitchen. The quality is superb, it cooks evenly and quickly (I'm using a medium heat versus blazing) and I have had no problems with clean up, sticking, or discolouration. I love this set and I would highly advise purchasing it!",

The heat transfers evenly. But I started to notice little rust spots in some of the pans, also when washing it doesn’t come clean with out a good scrub. They say not to use sos pads, seriously how do you get a pan clean without scrubbing. I have used soft sponge and it leaves marks on it. Very disappointed, I will never buythis again. Edit : 2022 so I buy these pots in Dec of 2019, one of the lid handles came off the lid. Not happy, I don’t recommend these pots. I guess I got what I paid for.",
