To the narco traffickers and the narco dictators, you'll eventually get the same treatment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A White House official told BBC Verify that Trump had authorised the strike on the boat, which they said was crewed by Tren de Aragua members, after it left Venezuela. The official added that the president was committed to using all means to prevent drugs reaching the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Pentagon has declined to share the legal advice it obtained before carrying out the strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News: \"we've got incredible assets and they are gathering in the region... those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><div class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\" data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Can Trump launch attacks without Congressional approval?</h2></div><div class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\" data-component=\"text-block\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Questions have also been raised as to whether the White House complied with US law in authorising the strike. The US constitution says that only Congress has the power to declare war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Article II - which lays out the president's powers - says that \"the president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army\" and some constitutional experts have suggested that this grants the president the power to authorise strikes against military targets. Trump administration sources have previously cited this provision when defending US strikes on Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it is unclear whether that provision extends to the use of force against non-state actors such as drug cartels.</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\"><a class=\"sc-f9178328-0 jsleNP\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwywjgynyxo\" target=\"_self\">Trump says 11 killed in US strike on drug-carrying vessel from Venezuela</a></li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\"><a class=\"sc-f9178328-0 jsleNP\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy1wn1x521o\" target=\"_self\">US offers $50m reward for arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro</a></li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\"><a class=\"sc-f9178328-0 jsleNP\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c87312qgpzgo\" target=\"_self\">Venezuela's ex-spy chief pleads guilty to narco-terrorism charges</a></li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rumen Cholakov, an expert in US constiutional law at King's College London told BBC Verify that since 9/11, US presidents have relied on the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force Act (AUMF) when carrying out strikes against groups responsible for the attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Its scope has been expanded consistently in subsequent administrations,\" he added. \"It is not immediately obvious that drug cartels such as Tren de Aragua would be within the President's AUMF powers, but that might be what \"narco-terrorists\" is hinting at.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Questions also remain as to whether Trump complied with the War Powers Resolution, which demands that the president \"in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities\".</p></div><div class=\"sc-1b734f04-0 hRSlbR\" data-component=\"ad-slot\" data-testid=\"ad-unit\"><div class=\"dotcom-ad\" data-testid=\"dotcom-mid_4\" id=\"dotcom-mid_4\"></div></div><div class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\" data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How did the US conduct the strike?</h2></div><div class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\" data-component=\"text-block\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is unclear what method the US used to launch the attack. Trump did not offer details in his news conference in the Oval Office and the Department of Defense has failed to offer further information.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Venezuela President Maduro has yet to respond to the US strikes, but his Communications Minister Freddy Ñáñez has suggested that the footage released by the White House may have been generated using AI. In a post to X, he suggested that water in the video \"looks very stylized and unnatural\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">BBC Verify has run the clip through SynthID - Google's AI detection software - and found no evidence that the footage is fake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The strikes come amid reports that the US has deployed several naval warships to the region in support of anti-narcotics operations against Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We've not been able to track all of these vessels. But using information from publicly-available onboard trackers, and videos on social media, we've potentially identified four of them in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A ship identifying itself as the USS Lake Erie - a guided missile cruiser - last transmitted its location in the Caribbean Sea on 30 August, east of the Panama Canal on 30 August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two others identifying themselves as the USS Gravely and USS Jason Dunham last transmitted their locations in mid-August, at the American base in Guantanamo Bay. A fourth, the USS Fort Lauderdale, transmitted its location north of the Dominican Republic on 28 August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump - who has long sought to oust Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro - has authorised a US$50m reward for any information leading to his arrest.
