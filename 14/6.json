Installation was a breeze, the manual explained everything clearly, and setting it up was super smooth. Once it was up and running, I was impressed by how sleek and well-designed it looks—it actually fits right in with our home decor. The mapping process was super smart, too. The robot quickly created an accurate map of our house, easily detecting objects and adjusting to the layout. Plus, the app is really handy, you can specify where your furniture and carpets are, tweak the room layout, and customize all sorts of settings like water levels or suction strength. One extra bonus feature I love is that the app gives me access to the robot’s camera. With three pets at home, it’s actually super helpful. I can drive the robot around, see what my cats are up to, and just have a little extra peace of mind. As someone with three cats and a complex furniture setup, I’m honestly thrilled with how well it cleans. It leaves the floors shiny, and having separate bins for clean and dirty water makes me feel like it’s really hygienic. Overall, I think it’s a good robot, intelligent one, with lots of features. Hope that helps!",

The suction is strong enough to pick up dust and hair from both hardwood floors and carpets, and the mop feature leaves the floor looking fresh without streaks. I like that it can adjust automatically when moving between floor types, so I don’t need to worry about it dragging water onto the carpet. The station is compact but does a lot: emptying, washing, and drying on its own, so I don’t have to spend much time on maintenance. The app is straightforward and lets me schedule cleaning or control it when I’m not at home. Voice control also works well for quick commands. It climbs over small transitions without getting stuck, which is helpful in my house. The battery recharges quickly, and it hasn’t died mid clean. Overall, it’s reliable, easy to use, and has reduced the effort I put into keeping the floors clean. I’m glad I decided to get it.",

It just roamed around the floors, running over everything it can. When I finally pushed it into the dock to charge because it couldn't find it's own home, it didn't charge. It told me it needed a firmware update. It couldn't do an update because it wasn't docked and charging required 20% battery. So now there is no option. I can't charge it or get it to find the dock. I think the robot maybe ok but I may have gotten a defective dock.

      "review_comment": "I’ve been using this robot vacuum and mop function for a little while now, and I have to say it’s a lifesaver. First off the design looks sleek and modern definitely something you don’t mind having out in the open. The cleaning performance is outstanding. It gets deep into corner pick up dust and pet hair easily and the mop function leaves my floor spotless. The mapping is very accurate, it never seems lost, and it navigates around furniture like a pro. Battery life is strong enough to cover my large house without constantly recharge and auto empty plus auto wash station make it truly hands free. It’s quit efficient and smart. I can control it right from my phone or with voice commands. Honestly it saves a lot of my times and efforts and my house feels clean than ever. If you’re on the fence, this is the one for you!",

It can be customized for different floor types, such as tiles, carpet, or wood, and cleans efficiently without missing spots. The mop washing and drying function is very convenient, eliminating the hassle of manual cleaning. Charging is fast, and it smartly remembers its cleaning progress, resuming automatically after recharging. Overall, the experience is extremely satisfying and highly recommended for any household.",

      "review_comment": "It’s super convenient! Previously I used two separate machines: one vacuum cleaner and one mop cleaner. Now I just need to use this one that has the dural functions! Besides, I needed to clean the mop cleaner manually since its self cleaning is not good and always causes smell. The self cleaning of this robot is great! I don’t need to manually clean it anymore! It can also detect whether it’s floor or carpet and then use different cleaning mode to clean them. It also has voice control function. That’s so cool! I can also control with an app. Cleaning house can be even done when I am out of home with app. There are lots of parameters can be tuned, for example strength of mopping and vacuuming. All in all, it saves a lot of time and cleans my home super clean. I strongly recommend it!",
