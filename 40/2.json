Is this by far exceeded my expectations. I even put it together myself! There were a few dings on the metal part, and a few imperfections on the wood top. However, the wood had a dull finish, so I bought a semi-gloss polyurethane and rubbed it on the wood and made it more finished looking. What a difference that made! The pub table itself is very unique. It looks like it could be antique, and definitely goes with all of my antiques. It is sturdy, and enough table space for cocktails were beverages of any kind.

I also can't figure out how to tighten the swivel once the proper height has been chosen, and as a result, the table top isn't stable, it keeps spinning in a loose way. It would be great to get a link to an assembly video or something.",
