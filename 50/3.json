      "review_comment": "This Bitzee Disney edition is seriously one of the coolest toys we’ve tried lately! My kids were instantly hooked—it’s like having a little digital Disney world you can actually interact with. With swipes, tilts, and taps, the characters respond in adorable ways that make the experience feel truly magical. There are 30 beloved Disney and Pixar characters to unlock, including favorites from Toy Story, Frozen, Moana, The Lion King, and more. Each one has a special “movie moment” that fans will recognize and love—like Stitch surfing or Mickey with his Sorcerer’s Hat. It’s so fun to see these iconic scenes come to life in such a cute, screen-free way. My kids (ages 6 and 8) love earning Wishing Stars and collecting new characters. The pod is super easy to use, and they can manage it all on their own. It keeps them entertained without the need for a tablet or TV, which I really appreciate. This would make a perfect gift for any Disney fan—honestly, I’ve caught myself playing with it too! It's compact, creative, and filled with magic. Highly recommend!",

      "review_title": "A very cute virtual pet that takes it to the next step",
      "review_comment": "When I saw a review of this appearing on YouTube randomly one day, it brought me back to my childhood when I used to play with virtual pets as a kid, except you couldn't touch the screen at the time. This takes it up a notch. It's a very cute toy that lets you take care up to 15 pets but I do kinda wish it'd take you time to level them up because when I first started playing with this it took less than 30 minutes-1 hour to get everyone leveled up. I haven't gotten bored of taking care of my pets though yet but do wish it wasn't too easy to level them all up. I do like the technology that it uses too. It looks like a hologram but you can touch it from the top unlike other virtual pets I used to own when I was a kid in the 2000s. I understand that it does flicker and the motor can be a little annoying at first but I gotten used to it and understand it's not the technology's fault. I'm not sensitive to flashing lights which isn't too bad but I'd be careful if you do buy this toy if you're sensitive to flashing lights or just avoid it for safety reasons. I think all the animals are very adorable and love the mercat the most. I just don't understand why in the instruction list it gives you a rarity scale for each pet when in reality, it's easy to get them all. I originally thought it meant you might not get every pet in the checklist but found out that those are the 15 pets you can get and it's pretty easy to get them too. Doesn't bother me much but why does it need a rarity scale when it's easy to get all the rares and legendaries over time? Plus some of the animals do make the same sounds as some other pets but it doesn't bother me much. Games are pretty easy to do. Simple but fun to play with. Sometimes the shaking won't recognize and you have to be quick enough but overtime I got it. Battery life is supposed to be up to 5 hours or so but battery life is still pretty great after playing for two days along with taking breaks over time. I would definitely recommend taking breaks often from the flashing lights and to also save battery life. Touching the screen and the touch bar is pretty easy to use. Just be gentle to it and don't mess with the screen. Don't poke the front of it, pinch the top, etc. Just a light tap on the top. As for starting your Bitzee, I do like the dog so much but I wish for each pod you buy or if you decide to restart your Bitzee, it'd give you a different pet instead the same animal. Not a huge deal but it'd have been cool if I gotten someone different first than a dog for each new Bitzee pod For future releases if this becomes popular enough, I'd love to see more pets in a series two pod or maybe if they decide to make new Bitzees from licenced stuff like Pokemon or Disney. I'd love to see that happen. I'd also love to see like more fantasy pets like dragons or sea monsters. I'd love to see this become popular especially for the holiday season this year since alot of people are saying this will become the hottest toy of the season which I do believe that. Overall I love this toy so much. Very much reminds me of my childhood owning toys that lets you take care of a animal or like a tomgatchi, but this time you can touch it. I know this is marketed towards kids obviously but I think adults will enjoy this too I feel like especially those who love to fidget with things and distract themselves like I do. I'm wheelchair bound and love to fidget with things. I'd consider this a fidget toy but kids do need to be careful with playing with the screen or not dropping it. Hopefully overtime the flexible screen won't be damaged overtime or the motor because I did read concerns about it but I think it'll be fine if you're careful with it. I'd love to see more series of Bitzees in the future ☺️ Thank you for reading",

The characters are adorable — Mickey, Stitch, and so many others — and it’s really easy to use. She figured it out in minutes and had so much fun unlocking new characters. It’s held up really well so far, even with daily use, and still works perfectly. The only downside is that once she unlocked all the characters (which happened pretty quickly), she lost interest in playing with it as much. It’s a really cute, screen‑free toy and worth it for the excitement and Disney magic — just don’t expect it to keep them entertained forever.",

Right out of the box, I was impressed by its vibrant and cute design. It has a friendly appearance that instantly appeals to both kids and adults alike. Setting up the Bitzee was straightforward; the instructions were clear, and I was playing with it in no time. The pet features a variety of interactions, including feeding, playing games, and even teaching tricks, which keeps the experience engaging. The built-in sensors allow it to react in real-time to my touch, which adds a fun and interactive element—I love how it responds differently based on how I interact with it!",
