    "review_comment": "The microphone assembled very well, came with a long enough cable that had a USB-C with a regular USB converter on the same end if needed, and worked immediately after plugging it in and telling my computer to use the microphone as default. Very much worth it for the price, the quality of the sound is great when I am on a voice call. The boom arm stays out of the way and is very rigid but easily flexible for movement when loosened.",

    "review_comment": "I have nothing but good things to say about this microphone. If you don't want to read a long review, the tl;dr: This is a great plug-n-play microphone that has great sound quality and a price that can't be beat.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, I started playing online games with friends. When things went back to normal a few years later, we kept playing online as many of us had moved to different areas of the US.\n\nDuring that time, I used a nice set of bluetooth headphones and that was adequate. We mostly played strategy games, board games, or poker games where sound quality didn't matter.\n\nIn 2024 we hopped on the Helldivers 2 train and the bluetooth headphones just weren't cutting it. To use the microphone with bluetooth, you have to accept the sound changes from full stereo to hands-free mono. For a game like Helldivers 2, that just didn't work. I couldn't hear anything at all.\n\nSo I decided to invest in a microphone. I know nothing at all about microphones and just wanted something relatively cheap that would work. I did a little research and the main thing people said was to get a \"dynamic mic\" as opposed to a \"condenser mic\". Shocker, the dynamic mics are more expensive, often costing $100+.\n\nI ended up getting this Fifine, which was significantly cheaper. And to be honest, I wouldn't be able to tell it was a cheap model. The quality of this mic looks really good and feels solid. It uses USB-C which is nice, and even has an XLR jack for the serious audio people (I don't know anything about this -- I just use the USB jack).\n\nIt is seriously plug-n-play. It took me all of 5 minutes to unbox and get set up at my desk. It just...works.\n\nThe only additional recommendation I'd make. Even though this is supposed a \"dynamic mic\" which only picks up sounds right next to the mic, I found this still picked up all my keyboard strokes and could even pick up mouse clicking.\n\nThe solution to this if you have an Nvidia card is Nvidia Broadcast. It is free and it has some sort of noise filtering that does an excellent job to remove background noise like what I mentioned above.\n\nIf you need a stand and a mic and don't want to dive down the rabbit-hole of audio equipment, this is probably your best value-to-quality option. It's no nonsense, dead easy to set up, and in conjunction with noise filtering software like Nvidia Broadcast sounds phenomenal.",

    "review_comment": "First of all, I want to say that Fifine packages all of their products so well, it's a small detail but for the affordability they package their products as if they were high end and much more expensive. So, you can laugh all you want but prior to buying this mic I was using a Sony pulse headset for all of my content and streaming, this mic sounds so much better than that headset it's not even funny! That Sony headset was $100, and this mic was half that price. The sound quality of this mic impressed the hell out of me; crisp and clear voiceovers are what this thing does! I was worried I might need a pop filter but so far, I have not heard the need for one. The rgb lights look great and the mute button is easy to hit when needed (although I use my Fifine stream controller for that) The only negative I have is the arm that comes with it, although its functionality is fine I wish there was a different methos for the padding besides a rubber sticker. That sticker ends up sliding out of place, maybe they could somehow make a recessed spot so the sticker doesn't move.",

    "review_title": "Audio Engineer Hobbyist's Opinon",
    "review_comment": "QUICK OVERLOOK: Good for the price, but take the springs off the boom arm the second you unbox it. Read more if you want to see what I mean.\n\nThis mic is an amazing low budget choice for live streaming, podcasting, and talking to your friends online. It looks good, sounds good and is easy to set up out of the box. It's also very versatile but simple at its core. This is my opinion if you're not thinking too seriously.\n\nNow, my honest overall opinion as someone who does audio engineering for a hobby, this product is pretty mediocre out of the box. The first thing I noticed was how extremely noisy the boom arm is any time you bump any part of it and if it's attached to a gaming desk, the vibrations from the keyboard etc. were obnoxious. That is until I realized the springs that the boom arm has have ZERO STRUCTURAL IMPORTANCE. I wanted to get rid of the vibrating sounds and noticed it was the springs that were making most of it. So I took them off hoping it wouldn't mess with the way the arm worked and lo and behold nothing bad happened. The way the arm worked did not change one bit and it turns out the springs have no use. Also, another thing about the structural build: The fact that the spot where the connections are at is on the bottom of the mic makes it really aggravating to use the swivel that it has. If you try to swivel it in a certain direction, the cords get stuck on the metal part that the mic is being held by.\n\nNext I’d like to mention the AUDIO QUALITY: Fairly good. A normal person not paying attention to quality wouldn't notice anything odd and would think it sounded pristine. However, in my personal opinion, out of the box, plugged into my computer via usb, the high frequencies like S’s and CH’s in speech were piercing my ears. So, VERY crisp sound, but almost too crisp for my taste.\n\nThis is kinda an off topic part, but is the thing that blew me away and sold my appreciation for this mic. I bought this mic with the intent and expectation to use it only for streaming and video gaming. But as an audio engineer, (and a bit of a weirdo) I've always been interested in ASMR. I’ve always had the thought of making my own, but I've never had the money or quality enough mic(s) for me to be happy with it. But I noticed how clean and quality this mic's sound was and it gave me the idea to try doing asmr with it. The only downside was that sounds like taping, and blanket rubbing on the mic were ruined by the metal grate that the actual physical microphone is surrounded by. So I became a goblin tinkerer and unscrewed a few things to get the piece off and voila, I was left with the top of the mic that was underneath everything and I was able to get very good tingly and comfy sounds out of it. So I decided to buy a second one of the same exact model in order to have a binaural effect.\n\nSo very good mic overall. Useful in many ways, you've just got to do some tinkering to get it to do what you want. It’s very good for recording talking, recording instruments like acoustic guitar and happens to be exceptional for ASMR.",

    "review_title": "Great quality NO XLR CABLE",
    "review_comment": "TLDR: if you’re wondering if it comes with a XLR cable, it doesn’t. Sound quality is great. I bought the fifine audio mixer to go with it.\n\nFirst I want to start off with the positives. This mic is easy to set up and is crisp and clean sounding. I did buy the fifine audio mixer to go with it and do run the mic through that via an XLR cable; but even with the default USB plug in to the computer the sound is pretty good especially for the price point. There is a mute button on the mic which is rendered useless by the audio mixer but that’s fine with me as I prefer the mute button on the mixer. The mics built in mute button is touch screen and I was finding myself constantly accidentally muting when I was doing adjustments. There are RGB lights on the mic and they do not distract while playing games which is nice. The arm is sturdier than one I purchased as a stand alone for $20 and feels nicer as well/has better mobility. It isn’t a super fancy mic arm but it’s really good again for the price point.\n\n I bought the audio mixer by the same brand and an XLR cable to go along with the mic because I wasn’t sure what the audio was like and wanted something really clean and professional sounding as I am a streamer. When looking through my own reviews of microphones and this one in specific I wanted to know if it came with and XLR cable and it does not which is why I wanted to note it in my own review. I want to clarify that I bought it knowing that it most likely did not as it was not listed on what was in the box or in any of the pictures. The box comes with the arm which is in 2 pieces (the arm itself and the part that attaches the arm to the desk) and the mic itself.\n\nI am actually very happy with this microphone quality and the arm. I was actually waiting for my old arm to break but decided to move some stuff around earlier and try out the new one and it feels really smooth to move around which is lovely for me, I can move my mic around without creaking!! Anyway I highly recommend this mic it was easy to set up and sounds great!",
