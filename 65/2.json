      "review_comment": "I bought the Canon EOS R50 as my first mirrorless camera for vlogging and I couldn’t be more satisfied. The image quality is excellent thanks to its 24.2 megapixels, and the 4K video is sharp and smooth—perfect for creating high-quality content without complications. The autofocus is very fast and accurate, even while moving, and the subject detection and tracking feature has been amazing when filming on the go or with more people in the frame. The included lens (RF-S 18-45mm) is very versatile for everyday use and ideal to get started without needing to invest in another lens right away. Plus, it’s a lightweight and compact camera, making it super easy to carry anywhere. The smartphone connection is very useful for quickly transferring photos and videos, and also for remotely controlling the camera. In short, if you’re looking for an easy-to-use, powerful camera designed for content creators, this is a great choice. Highly recommended.",

I don't have to charge the battery very often. The base is smaller than a DSLR camera but that just makes it easier to bring around everywhere. I've taken a lot of cool photos with it so far! I would highly recommend this camera, but if you want a better zoom, the base kit lens only goes up to 45mm so you'd have to purchase another lens.",

If you want a good camera and don't want to spend thousands on just the body, this camera is for you. I'm a fan of film, and I'd bought a different camera only to realize that it wasn't what I needed and then sprung for this one. I now have two separate lenses that accomplish the same goal at different distances, and this camera is absolutely stellar at recording, making it not just ideal, but a necessity for anyone who wants a quality picture. If you want good lens options, go with either the, \"Canon RF16mm F2.8 STM Lens\" or the \"Canon RF35mm F1.8\". Both are extremely amazing to pair with this, just make sure to buy a second battery (Canon Battery Pack LP-E17) (Image is a little blurry due to motion, the quality is top tier, you can see every hair on a person's face during photo mode)",

But I've had Sony, NIkon and Minolta cameras in the past, and some Canon features are simply NOT universal. So the learning curve has been very steep for someone as experienced as me. This is NOT a professional camera. It's very nice, and what I'd consider to be a \"semi-pro\" camera. And Canon hasn't shied away from allowing amateurs to check it out. Also, it has only two lenses available now, but for me, that's enough. The problem is that Canon, like most electronics manufacturers these days, offers only a few pages of almost useless documentation for its use. The 100-small-page instruction book that comes with it satisfied my original expectations -- until I realized only about 10 pages of VERY widely-spaced text was in ENGLISH! That was just enough to allow me to turn the camera ON! Users can go online and find some free tutorials, but that's more than a little inconvenient when you're learning to use the features.",
