He has moved it around and is able to use it in many versatile ways.  Size is perfect for a desk setup or even on a boom stand.  Mic sensitivity is pretty good we have tested talking in different areas at different volumes and it picks up what we want and doesn't what we didn't want it do.",

I haven't had any problems with this microphone what so ever compared to the shure microphone that I did have. I would recommend this microphone to people if they want to stream but can't afford a super expensive one. It's really good quality and durable for what I was looking for. The sound quality also comes off really well, it picks me up whenever I need it. The cable also came with an adapter to plug in with a USB, it was super easy to connect to the pc as well. 10/10.",

    "review_comment": "Got this microphone as an upgrade from another Fifine one. My use is light which is just discord calls with friends and conference meetings at work. It looks great in white and fits my setup.\n\nI use it in USB mode, and it was basically plug-and-play no extra drivers needed and every one I talked to said that the sound quality is clear, crisp, and arguably professional. The built-in gain knob are super convenient, and I like having a physical mute button, In my opinion all microphones should have one.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I’d say the buttons could be improved, they are touch-sensitive and easy to activate by accident, especially if you don't care for RBG like me, who keeps having it turning on whenever I go to move the mic around.\n\nAlso, if you plan to use XLR, you'll need to provide your own cable and interface. But overall, for the price, the FIFINE mic delivers excellent value.",

The build quality is solid and the RGB lighting adds a stylish touch to my setup. The sound clarity is excellent, making it perfect for podcasting, streaming, and even casual gaming chats. I love the convenience of having both USB and XLR options, as well as the easy-access mute button and headphone jack for real-time monitoring. Setup was plug-and-play, super simple. For the price, this mic truly exceeds expectations. Highly recommended for anyone looking for professional sound without breaking the bank!",
