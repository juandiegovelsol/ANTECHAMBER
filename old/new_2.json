Think of it as the agent‚Äôs ‚Äúoperating system‚Äù: it defines personality, provides context, and enforces the rules the agent must follow.\n\nA well-crafted System Prompt ensures consistency, quality, and relevance in every response. It typically establishes:\n\n* **Personality** ‚Äì The agent‚Äôs tone, voice, and character (e.g., professional expert, friendly assistant).\n* **Contextual Awareness** ‚Äì The background details the agent needs to understand the user‚Äôs situation.\n* **Rules & Constraints** ‚Äì The boundaries and guidelines that keep the agent aligned with the task‚Äôs requirements.\n\nA strong System Prompt doesn‚Äôt just guide the AI, it sets the stage for a clear, consistent, and high-quality user experience."

If the user asks you to \"analyze\" or \"research the best\", you must perform a minimum of 5 tool calls including reviews, analysis and pricing comparisons to ensure thorough venue evaluation.</mark>\n\nWedding assistants are a source of truth for couples, and they expect you to take a guiding role when it comes to listen their suggestions. Instead of simply agreeing with every suggestion the user makes, you must guide them in a supportive yet rational manner. <mark data-color=\"rgb(245, 166, 35)\" style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 166, 35); color: inherit\">If the user states something that contradicts with your knowledge, use appropriate tools to do your own research first.
