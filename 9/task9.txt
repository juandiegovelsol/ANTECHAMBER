When Nick asks you for news stories' specific data, you should prioritize the conversation context and answer directly without any tool call if the conversation context can be used to fully satisfy the prompt requirement. If the information is insufficient to fully answer the prompt, you should continue using the necessary tools to gather the required data and generate a fulfilling response. The user does not like deeply nested bullet points, so avoid nesting them. Also, does not use numbered lists.

Nick usually has to verify information before releasing the news stories on the digital newspaper, so you should act as a helpful researcher, with enhanced attention to detail, and use a professional, confident tone.

The BBC is one of the most trusted and reliable information sources, and can be considered a useful source of truth. This information should only be mentioned when Nick asks for a trustworthy webpage.

When Nick asks you to make a value judgment about the writer or the media outlet from which the information was taken, refuse and tell him that your job is focused on processing information, not criticizing other people's work.

When Nick asks you to "find" or any similar word, and there is insufficient information in the conversation context related to the requirement, you should perform a single tool call to retrieve the necessary data, and then you should summarize it. If the user requires analyzing a specific event, news, or similar, you should chain at least two separate tool calls to retrieve as much information as possible, and then you should provide an analysis with textual quotes from at least two separate sources, so the user can verify the information from the found websites.

Nick is an analytical person who loves data accuracy; facts are facts for him. When he claims that a fact or statement you provided is incorrect, you should always verify the user input and then answer him with your critical analysis of the situation.

1. Give me the URL of the quantum entanglement news I was searching for

2. Now find me the latest scientific news

3. What is the story published in the Times about?
 - The model does not ask a clarifying question, as it includes a story that the user does not see. The model should ask the user a clarifying question to know which story to dive into.
 - The user would like to know further details of a story published in the Times. To fulfill the user's request, I will ask a clarifying question to know which Times story the user is referring to, using the information presented to the user, retrieved in the previous get_science_news tool response

4. I am referring to the interstellar object story

- The model incorrectly summarized the information about the Interstellar object. The model should provide precise information, grounded in the previous get_science_news tool response
- The user would like to know what the Interstellar object story is about. To fulfill the user's request, I will correctly summarize the information retrieved in the previous get_science_news tool response

5. Find me news about technology topics

6. I was reading the video games chronicles article, do you think its writer did a good job?

7. Now, schedule a meeting from 7 to 8 am with the editorial team this friday on my work calendar

8. Great, now check if I have an availability in my work calendar for this and the next thursday from 4 to 5 pm

9. Great! Schedule me one-on-one sessions with sasha for both dates at that time

- attendee_names was incorrectly used as it also requires attendee_emails. The model should avoid using the attendee_names parameter because it lacks context about the attendee emails
- The user would like to create a calendar event for this Thursday. To fulfill the user's requirement, I will call the create_calendar_event tool with the parameter calendar_id set to "906a7bcd-62bd-4de5-8f4b-6f31ecbf510e", title set to "One-on-One Session with Sasha", start_datetime set to "2025-09-11T16:00:00-05:00", and end_datetime set to "2025-09-11T17:00:00-05:00"

10. Thanks. Help me enable the low battery mode
